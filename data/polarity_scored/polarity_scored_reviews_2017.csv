https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"Summary: The paper presents low-rank bilinear pooling that uses Hadamard product (commonly known as element-wise multiplication). The paper implements low-rank bilinear pooling on an existing model (Kim et al., 2016b) and builds a model for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that outperforms the current state-of-art by 0.42%. The paper presents various ablation studies of the new VQA model they built.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"1. The paper presents new insights into element-wise multiplication operation which has been previously used in VQA literature (such as Antol et al., ICCV 2015) without insights on why it should work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"2. The paper presents a new model for the task of VQA that beats the current state-of-art by 0.42%. However, I have concerns about the statistical significance of the performance (see weaknesses below).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,3. The various design choices made in model development have been experimentally verified.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,Weaknesses/Suggestions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"1. When authors explicitly (keeping rest of the model architecture same) compared low-rank bilinear pooling with compact bilinear pooling, they found that low-rank bilinear pooling performs worse. Hence, it could not be experimentally verified that low-rank bilinear pooling is better in performance than compact bilinear pooling (at least for the task of VQA).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"2. The authors argue that low-rank bilinear pooling uses 25% less parameters than compact bilinear pooling. So, could the authors please explain how does the reduction in number of parameters help experimentally? Does the training time of the model reduce significantly? Can we train the model with less data?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"3. One of the contributions of the paper is that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-art on VQA by 0.42%. However, I am skeptical that the performance of the proposed model is statistically significantly better than the current state-of-art.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"However, it could not be justified that low-rank bilinear pooling leads to better performance than compact biliear pooling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,It does lead to reduction in number of parameters but it is not clear how much that helps experimentally.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"So, to be more convinced I would like the authors to provide experimental justification of why low-rank bilinear pooling is better than other forms of pooling.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,Since the main contribution of the,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,paper seems to be slightly better performance with fairly large reduction in parameters vs. compact bilinear something should be said about choice of those hyper parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,If you increase embedded and output dimensions to equalize parameters to the compact bilinear model are further gains possible?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,"The meaning of visual attention in this model along with the number of glimpses should be tied to the sentence embedding, so now we are looking at particular spatial components when that part of the sentence is encoded, then we stack according to your equation 9?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,This work proposes to approximate the bilinear pooling (outer product) with a formulation which uses the Hadamard Product (element-wise product).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,This formulation is evaluated on the visual question answering (VQA) task together with several other model variants.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,Strength:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,1. The paper discusses how the Hadamard product can be used to approximate the full outer product.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rhWnZkg,2.2. An experimental comparison to the full outer product (e.g. for a lower dimension) is missing.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,The authors failed to bring the novel idea.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,It is very similar to (Hinton et al. 2016).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,This is probably not enough for ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"Inspired by the analysis on the effect of the co-label similarity (Hinton et al., 2015), this paper proposes a soft-target regularization that iteratively trains the network using weighted average of the exponential moving average of past labels and hard labels as target argument of loss.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,They claim that this prevents the disappearing of co-label similarity after early training and  yields a competitive regularization to dropout without sacrificing network capacity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"In order to make a fair comparison to dropout,  the dropout should be tuned carefully.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,Showing that it performs better than dropout regularization for some particular values of dropout (Table 2) does not demonstrate a convincing advantage.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,It is possible that dropout performs better after a reasonable tuning with cross-validation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,The baseline architectures used in the experiments do not belong the recent state of art methods thus yielding significantly lower accuracy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"It seems also that experiment setup does not involve any data augmentation, the results can also change with augmentation.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,Therefore the significance of the method is not convincingly demonstrated in empirical study.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,Co-label similarities could be calculated using softmax results at final layer rather than using predicted labels.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"The advantage over dropout is not clear in Figure 4, the dropout is set to 0.2 without any cross-validation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,Regularizing by enforcing the training steps to keep co-label similarities is interesting idea but not very novel and the results are not significant.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,This manuscript tries to tackle neural network regularization by blending the target distribution with predictions of the model itself.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"In this sense it is similar in spirit to scheduled sampling (Bengio et al) and SEARN (Daume et al) DAgger (Ross et al) which consider a ""roll-in"" mixture of the target and model distributions during training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"It was clarified in the pre-review questions that these targets are generated on-line rather than from a lagged distribution, which I think makes the algorithm pseudocode somewhat misleading if I understand it correctly.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkCPyXm1l,"The author points out that co-label similarity is better preserved by this method but it doesn't follow that this is causal re: regularization; a natural baseline would be a fixed, soft label distribution, as well as one where the softening/temperature of the label distribution is gradually reduced (as one would expect for this method to do as the model gets closer and closer to reproducing the target distribution).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,Some of them are really small and difficult to understand since the labels on the figures appear very small and somewhat unreadable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,A small question:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,* Do you also backpropagate through,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,This paper proposes a novel method for accelerating optimization near saddle points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,The basic idea is to repel the current parameter vector from a running average of recent parameter values.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,This method is shown to optimize faster than a variety of other methods in a variety of datasets and architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,"On the surface, the proposed method seems extremely close to momentum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,It would be very valuable to think of a clear diagram illustrating how it differs from momentum and why it might be better near a saddle point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,"The illustration of better convergence on the toy saddle example is not what I mean here—optimization speed comparisons are always difficult due to the many details and hyper parameters involved, so seeing it work faster in one specific application is not as useful as a conceptual diagram which shows a critical case where CPN will behave differently from—and clearly qualitatively better than—momentum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,Another way of getting at the relationship to momentum would be to try to find a form for R_t(f) that yields the exact momentum update.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1jnyXXJx,You could then compare this with the R_t(f) used in CPN.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The methods are technically similar to the “exemplar network” (Dosovitskiy 2015).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Cropping patches from a single image can be taken as a type of data augmentation, which is comparable to the data augmentation of positive sample (the exemplar) in (Dosovitskiy 2015).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The paper is experimentally misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The results reported in this paper are based on fine-tuning the whole network with supervision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"However, in Table 2, the results of exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) is from unsupervised feature learning (the network is not finetuned with labeled samples, and only a classifier is trained upon the features).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Therefore, the comparison is not fair.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"I suspect that exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) would achieve similar improvements from fine-tuning; so, without such comparisons (head-to-head comparison with and without fine-tuning based on the same architecture except for the loss), the experimental results are not fully convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Regarding the comparison to “What-where” autoencoder (Zhao et al, 2015), it will be interesting to compare against it in large-scale settings, as shown by Zhang et al, ICML 2016 (Augmenting Supervised Neural Networks with Unsupervised Objectives for Large-Scale Image Classification).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Training an AlexNet is not very time-consuming with latest (e.g., TITAN-X level) GPUs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The proposed method seems useful only for natural images where different patches from the same image can be similar to each other.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"The proposed self supervised loss is formulated using a Siamese architecture and encourages patches from the same image to lie closer in feature space than a contrasting patch taken from a different, random image.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The loss is very similar in spirit to that of Doersch et al. ICCV 2015 and Isola et al. ICLR 2016 workshop.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,It seems that the proposed loss is actually a simplified version of Doersch et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"ICCV 2015 in that it does not make use of the spatial offset, a freely available self supervised signal in natural images.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Intuitively, it seems that the self-supervised problem posed by this method is strictly simpler, and therefore less powerful, than that of the aforementioned work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,I would like to see more discussion on the comparison of these two approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,Nevertheless the proposed method seems to be effective in achieving good empirical results using this simple loss.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"Though more implementation details should be provided, such as the effect of patch size, overlap between sampled patches, and any other important measures taken to avoid trivial solutions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,This paper presents a novel way to do unsupervised pretraining in a deep convolutional network setting (though likely applicable to fully-connected nets as well).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"The method is that of ‘spatial constrasting’, i.e. of building triplets from patches of input images and learning a presentation that assigns a high score for patches coming from the same image and a low score for patches from diferent images.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The method is simple enough that I am surprised that no-one has tried this before (at least according to the previous work in the submission).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,Here are some comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,The usage of P(f_i^1 | f_i^2) in Section 4.1 is a bit odd.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,Shouldn’t the number of patches sampled in Algorithm 1 be a hyper-parameter rather than just be 1?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,Have the authors tried any other value?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1vyujVye,"I think there are some missing details in the paper, like the patch size or whether the authors have played with it at all (I think this is an important hyper-parameter).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"The concepts, ideas and previous literature are quite nicely and carefully presented.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,The only major concern I have - and I apologize to the authors for not raising this earlier - are the experiments in section 3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"In particular, I don't quite get the scenario.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"The reasoning here seems to be as follows: given information < A, B, C, D >, I want to give the public the value of D (e.g. movies watched) without releasing information about C (e.g. gender).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"In this scenario, Eve would need to be able to reconstruct D as good as possible without gaining information about C.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"What is described in section 3, however, is that D and D-public are both reconstructed by Bob, but why would Bob reconstruct the latter (he is not public, in particular because he is allowed to reconstruct C, which is not tested here)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"Also, Eve only tries to estimate C, thus rendering the scenario not different in any way to the scenario considered in section 2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,I have two more minor concerns:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"1) As raised in the pre-review, Eve should actually be stronger then Alice and Bob in order to be able to compensate for the missing key.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,The authors noted they have been doing these experiments and are going to add the results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,2) In any natural encryption case I would expect the length of the key to be much shorter then the length of the message.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"This, however, could potentially make the scenario much easier for Eve (although I doubt any of the results will change if the key is long enough).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HEBe_Jl,"I like the creative application of adversarial training to a completely different domain, and I believe it could be the starting point of a very interesting direction in cryptographic systems or in privacy applications (although it is unclear whether the weak guarantees of neural network based approaches can ever be overcome).",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,"Thus image style is encoded in a very condensed subset of the network parameters, with only two parameters per feature map.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,This enables to easily incorporate new styles into an existing network by fine-tuning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,"At the same time, the quality of the generated stylisations is comparable to existing feed-forward single-style transfer networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,"While this also means that the stylisation results in the paper are limited by the quality of current feed-forward methods, the proposed method seems general enough to be combined with future improvements in feed-forward style transfer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,"Finally, the paper shows that having multiple styles encoded in one feature space allows to gradually interpolate between different styles to generate new mixtures of styles.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,This is comparable to interpolating between the Gram Matrices of different style images in the iterative style transfer algorithm by Gatys et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,and comes with similar limitations: Right now the parameters of the style feature space are hard to interpret and therefore there is little control over the stylisation outcome when moving in that feature space.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,Here I see the most potential for improvement of the paper: The parameterisation of style in terms of scale and shift parameters of individual features seems like a promising basis to achieve interpretable style features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,It would be a great addition to explore to what extend statements such as “The parameters of neuron N in layer L encodes e.g. the colour or brush-strokes of the styles” can be made.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJO-BuT1g,"I agree that this is a potentially laborious endeavour, but even just qualitative statements of this kind that are demonstrated with the respective manipulations in the stylisation would be very interesting.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It might even be worthwhile to consider a synthetic experiment where two completely different types of image are appended (i.e. birds on the left and flowers on the right) and show that the hypernetwork helps in this situation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"It may be the case that for convnets, the cases where hypernetworks help are very specific.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"For RNNs, it seems to be the case that explicitly changing the nature of the computation depending on the position in the sequence greatly improves generalization.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"While a usual RNN could learn to store a counter (indicating the position in the sequence), the hypernetwork could be a more efficient way to add capacity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Applications to time series forecasting and modeling could be an interesting area for future work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Although the trainable parameters might be reduced significantly, unfortunately the training and recognition speech cannot be reduced in this way.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Unfortunately, as the results show, the authors could not get better results with less parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"However, the proposed structure with even more number of parameters shows significant gain e.g. in LM.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"The paper should be reorganized, and shortened.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It is sometimes difficult to follow and sometimes inconsistent.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"E.g.: the weights of the feedforward network depend only on an embedding vector (see also my previous comments on linear bottlenecks), whereas in recurrent network the generated weights also depend on the input observation or its hidden representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Could the authors provide the num. of trainable parameters for Table 6?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Probably presenting less results could also improve the readability.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Only marginal accept due to the writing style.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"This paper proposes an interesting new method for training neural networks, i.e., a hypernetwork is used to generate the model parameters of the main network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The authors demonstrated that the total number of model parameters could be smaller while achieving competitive results on the image classification task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In particular, the hyperLSTM with non-shared weights can achieve excellent results compared to conventional LSTM and its variants on a couple of LM talks, which is very inspiring.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,This work demonstrates that it is possible to generate the neural network model parameters using another network that can achieve competitive results by a few relative large scale experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"The idea itself is very inspiring, and the experiments are very solid.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,cons,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The paper would be much stronger if it was more focused.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In particular, it is unclear what is the key advantage of this hypernetwork approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It is argued that in the paper that can achieve competitive results using smaller number of trainable model parameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"However, in the running time, the computational complexity is the same as the standard main network for static networks, such as ConvNet, and the computational cost is even larger for dynamic networks such as LSTMs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The improvements of hyperLSTMs over conventional LSTM and its variants seem mainly come from increasing the number of model parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"minor question,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The ConvNet and LSTM used in the experiments do not have a large softmax layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"For most of the word-level tasks for either LM or MT, the softmax layer could be more than 100K. Is it going to be challenging for the hyperNetwork generate large number of weights for that case, and is it going to slowing the training down significantly?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,*** Paper Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The paper proposes to a new neural network architecture.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The layer weights of a classical network are computed as a function of a latent representation associated with the layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Two instances are presented (i) a CNN where each layer weight is computed from a lower dimensional layer embedding vector; (ii) an RNN where each layer weight is computed from a secondary RNN state.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,*** Review Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,I like the idea of bringing multiplicative RNNs and their predecessors back into the spotlight.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,LM and MT results are excellent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The paper could be better written.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It is too long for the conference format and need refocussing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"On related work, the relation with multiplicative RNN and their generic tensor product predecessor (Order 2 networks, wrt C. Lee Giles definition) should be mentioned in the related work section and the differences with earlier research need to be explained and motivated (by the way it is better to say that something is revisiting an old idea or training it at modern scale/on modern tasks than ommitting it).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"on focus, it is not clear if your goal is to achieve better performance or more compact networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In the RNN section you lean toward the former, in the CNN section you seem to lean toward the latter.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,I would suggest to make the paper shorter and clearer possibly leaving the CNN results for latter publication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The relation with multiplicative/order 2 networks and eventual differences need to be explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,*** Detailed Review ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Multiplicative networks are an extremely powerfull architecture and bringing them back into the spotlight is excellent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"This paper has excellent results but suffer poor presentation, lack of a clear focus.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It spends time on details and ommit important points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In its current form, it is much too long to long and his not self contained without the appendices.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Spending more time on multiplicative RNNs, order 2 networks at the begining of the paper would be excellent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,This will let you highlight the difference between this paper and earlier work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"It would also be necessary to spend a little time on why multiplicative RNN were less used than gated RNN: it seems that the optimization problem their training involve is tricker and it would be helpful to explain whether you had a harder time tweaking optimization parameters or whether you needed longer training sessions compared to LSTMs, regular CNN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"On name, I am not sure that ""hypernetwork"" help the reader understand better what the proposed architecture compared to multiplicative interactions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In section 3.2, you seem to imply that there are different settings of hypernetworks that allow to vary from an RNN to a CNN, this is not clear to me, maybe you could show how this would work on a simple temporal problem with equations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"The work on CNN and RNN are rather disconnected to me: for CNN, you seem to be interested in a low rank structure of the weights, showing that similar performance can be achieved with less weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It is not clear to me why to pursue that goal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Do you expect speedups?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,less memory for embedded applications?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"In that case you should compare with alternative strategies, e.g. model compression (Caruana et al 2006, aka Dark Knowledge, Hinton et al 2014) or hashed networks (Chen et al 2015).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"For RNN, you seem to target better perplexity/BLEU and model compactness is not a priority.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Instead of making the weights have a simpler structure, you make them richer, i.e. dependent over time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,It seems in that case models might be bigger and take longer to train.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"You might want to comment on training time, inference time, memory requirement in that case, as you highlight it might be an important goal in the CNN section.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Overall, I am not sure it helps to have this mixed message.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,I would rather see the paper fit in the conference format with the RNN results alone and a clearer explanation and defers the publications of the CNN results when a proper comparison with memory concerned methods is performed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Some of the discussions are not clear to me, I am not sure what message the reader should get from Figure 2 or from the discussion on saturation statistics (p10, Figure 5).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Similarly, I am not sure if Figure 4 is showing anything: everything should change more drastically at word boundaries even in a regular LSTM (states, gates units should look very different before/after a space); without such a comparison it is hard to see if this is unique to your network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The results on handwriting generation are harder to compare for me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Log-loss are hard to understand, I have no sense whether the difference between models is significant (what would be the variance in this metric under boostrap sampling of the training set?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,I am not sold either on qualitative metric were human can assess quality but human cannot evaluate if the network is repeating the training set.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Did you thing at precision/recall metric for ink, possibly with some spatial tolerance ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,(e.g. evaluation of segmentation tasks in vision).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,The MT experiments are insufficiently discussed in the main text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,"Overall, I would suggest to make the paper shorter and clearer possibly leaving the CNN results for latter publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,You need to properly discuss the relation to multiplicative/order 2 networks and highlight the differences.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpACe1lx,Unclear discussion can be eliminated to make the experimental setup and the results presentation clearer in the main text.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,The paper explains dropout with a latent variable model where the dropout variable (0 or 1 depending on which units should be dropped) is not observed and is accordingly marginalised.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Maximum likelihood under this model is not tractable but standard dropout then corresponds to a simple Monte Carlo approximation of ML for this model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"The paper then introduces a theoretical framework for analysing the discrepancy (called inference gap) between the model at training (model ensemble, or here the latent variable model), and the model at testing (where usually what should be an expectation over the activations over many models becomes the activation of one model with averaged weights).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,This framework introduces several notions (e.g. expectation linearity) which allow the study of which transition functions (and more generally layers) can have a small inference gap.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Theorem 3 gives a bound on the inference gap.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Finally a new regularisation term is introduced to account for minimisation of the inference gap during learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"Experiments are performed on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and show that the method has the potential to perform better than standard dropout and at the level of Monte Carlo Dropout (the standard method to compute the real dropout outputs consistently with the training assumption of an ensemble, of course quite expensive computationally)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,The study gives a very interesting theoretical model for dropout as a latent variable model where standard dropout is then a monte carlo approximation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,This is very probably widely applicable to further studies of dropout.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,The framework for the study of the inference gap is interesting although maybe somewhat less widely applicable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,The proposed model is convincing although 1.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,it is tested on simple datasets 2.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,the gains are relatively small and 3. there is an increased computational cost during training because a new hyper-parameter is introduced.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,p6 line 8 typo: expecatation,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,This paper introduces dropout as a latent variable model (LVM).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Leveraging this formulation authors analyze the dropout “inference gap” which they define to be the gap between network output during training (where an instance of dropout is used for every training sample) and test (where expected dropout values are used to scale node outputs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,They introduce the notion of expectation linearity and use this to derive bounds on the inference gap under some (mild) assumptions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"Furthermore, they propose use of per-sample based inference gap as a regularizer, and present analysis of accuracy of models with expectation-linearization constraints as compared to those without.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,One relatively minor issue I see with the LVM view of dropout is that it seems applicable only to probabilistic models whereas dropout is more generally applicable to deep networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,However I’d expect that the regularizer formulation of dropout would be effective even in non-probabilistic models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"MC dropout on page 8 is not defined, please define.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,On page 9 it is mentioned that with the proposed regularizer the standard dropout networks achieve better results than when Monte Carlo dropout is used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,This seems to be the case only on MNIST dataset and not on CIFAR?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,From Tables 1 and 2 it also appears that MC dropout achieves best performance across tasks and methods but it is of course an expensive procedure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Comments on the computational efficiency of various dropout procedures - to go with the accuracy results - would be quite valuable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Couple of typos:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Pg.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,2 “ … x is he input …” -> “ … x is the input …”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Pg.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"5 “ … as defined in (1), is …” -> ref.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,to (1) is not right at two places in this paragraph,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"Overall it is a good paper, I think should be accepted and discussed at the conference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,"This paper puts forward a not entirely new, but also not sufficiently understood interpretation of dropout regularization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,The authors derive useful theorems that estimate or put bounds on key quantities that are of interest when analyzing dropout regularized networks from their perspective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,They furthermore introduce an explicit regularization term that should have a well understood impact on these key quantities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,In the experimental section they convincingly show that the proposed regularization indeed has the expected effect and that their perspective on dropout is therefore useful and meaningful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,Their proposed regularization also seems to have a positive impact on the models performance but they demonstrate this only on rel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,small scale benchmark problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,I therefore don’t belief that this approach will have a large impact on how practitioner train models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkGabzZgl,But their general perspective is well aligned with the recently proposed idea of “Dropout as a bayesian approximation” and the insights and theorems in this paper might enable future work in that direction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,The main contribution of this paper seems to be an introduction of a set of differential graph transformations which will allow you to learn graph->graph classification tasks using gradient descent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,This maps naturally to a task of learning a cellular automaton represented as sequence of graphs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"In that task, the graph of nodes grows at each iteration, with nodes pointing to neighbors and special nodes 0/1 representing the values.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"Proposed architecture allows one to learn this sequence of graphs, although in the experiment, this task (Rule 30) was far from solved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"This idea is combined with ideas from previous papers (GGS-NN) to allow the model to produce textual output rather than graph output, and use graphs as intermediate representation, which allows it to beat state of the art on BaBi tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"This paper proposes learning on the fly to represent a dialog as a graph (which acts as the memory), and is first demonstrated on the bAbI tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"Graph learning is part of the inference process, though there is long term representation learning to learn graph transformation parameters and the encoding of sentences as input to the graph.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"This seems to be the first implementation of a differentiable memory as graph: it is much more complex than previous approaches like memory networks without significant gain in performance in bAbI tasks, but it is still very preliminary work, and the representation of memory as a graph seems much more powerful than a stack.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"Clarity is a major issue, but from an initial version that was constructive and better read by a computer than a human, the author proposed a hugely improved later version.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"This original, technically accurate (within what I understood) and thought provoking paper is worth publishing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,The preliminary results do not tell us yet if the highly complex graph-based differentiable memory has more learning or generalization capacity than other approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The performance on the bAbI task is comparable to the best memory networks, but still worse than more traditional rule induction (see http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/papers/aaai2016-sub.pdf).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,This is still clearly promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The sequence of transformation in algorithm 1 looks sensible, though the authors do not discuss any other operation ordering.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"In particular, it is not clear to me that you need the node state update step",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"T_h if you have the direct reference update step T_h,direct.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"It is striking that the only trick that is essential for proper performance is the ‘direct reference’ , which actually has nothing to do with the graph building process, but is rather an attention mechanism for the graph input: attention is focused on words that are relevant to the node type rather than the whole sentence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,So the question “how useful are all these graph operations” remain.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"A much simpler version of a similar trick may have been proposed in the context of memory networks, also for ICLR'17 (see match type in ""LEARNING END-TO-END GOAL-ORIENTED DIALOG"" by Bordes et al)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The authors also mention the time and size needed to train the model: is the issue arising for learning, inference or both?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,A description of the actual implementation would help  (no pointer to open source code is provide).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,The author mentions Theano in one of my questions: how are the transformations compiled in advance as units?,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,How is the gradient back-propagated through the graph is this one is only described at runtime?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"Typo: in the appendices B.2 and B.2.1, the right side of the equation that applies the update gate has h’_nu while it should be h_nu.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"In the references, the author could mention the pioneering work  of Lee Giles on representing graphs with  RNNs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,Revision: I have improved my rating for the following reasons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,Pointers to an highly readable and well structured Theano source is provided.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The delta improvement of the paper has been impressive over the review process, and I am confident this will be an impactful paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"Much simpler alternatives approaches such as Memory Networks seem to be plateauing for problems such as dialog modeling, we need alternatives.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The architecture is this work is still too complex, but this is often as we start with DNNs, and then find simplifications that actually improve performance",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,The paper proposes an extension of the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network by including in this model the ability to produce complex graph transformations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The underlying idea is to propose a method that will be able build/modify a graph-structure as an internal representation for solving a problem, and particularly for solving question-answering problems in this paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The author proposes 5 different possible differentiable transformations that will be learned on a training set, typically in a supervised fashion where the state of the graph is given at each timestep.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"A particular occurence of the model is presented that takes a sequence as an input a iteratively update an internal graph state to a final prediction, and which can be applied for solving QA tasks (e.g BaBi) with interesting results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"The approach  in this paper is really interesting since the proposed model is able to maintain a representation of its current state as a complex graph, but still keeping the property of being differentiable and thus easily learnable through gradient-descent techniques.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,It can be seen as a succesfull attempt to mix continuous and symbolic representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"It moreover seems more general that the recent attempts made to add some 'symbolic' stuffs in differentiable models (Memory networks, NTM, etc...)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,since the shape of the state is not fixed here and can evolve.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"My main concerns is about the way the model is trained i.e by providing the state of the graph at each timestep which can be done for particular tasks (e.g Babi) only, and cannot be the solution for more complex problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0NvFzxl,"My other concern is about the whole content of the paper that would perhaps best fit a journal format and not a conference format, making the article still difficult to read due to its density.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The paper presents two main contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"(1) A novel model visualization and photo manipulation technique that allows to transform an image using a paintbrush, much like in an image editing software.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,(2) A hybridization of GANs and VAEs called Introspective Adversarial Network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The main problem I have with the paper is that it feels very much like two papers in one with a very loose story tying the two together.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"On one hand, the neural photo editing technique is presented in sufficient detail to be reproducible and it is shown to be effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"I personally find the idea exciting, but in order for it to be of interest to the ICLR community I think more emphasis should be put on what insights such a technique allows to gain on trained models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"On the other hand, the IAF model is introduced, along with multiple network architecture modifications for improving its performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"One criticism that I have regarding the presentation is that it makes it hard to assign credit to individual ideas when they are presented in a ""list of things to make it work"" fashion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,I would like to see more empirical results in that direction to help clear up things.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Overall I think the paper proposes interesting ideas, but given its lack of focus on a single, cohesive story I think it is not yet ready for publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,UPDATE:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The rating has been updated to a 6 following the authors' reply.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,UPDATE:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The rewritten paper is more focused and precise than the previous version.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The ablation studies and improved evaluation of the IAN model help to the make clear the relative contributions of the proposed MDC and orthogonal regularization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Though the paper is much improved, in my opinion there is still too much emphasis on the photo-editing interface.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"In addition, the MDC blocks are used in the generator of the model but their efficacy is measured via discriminative experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,All-in-all I am updating my score to a 5.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,==========,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"This paper proposes a hybridization of a VAE and a GAN whereby the generator both generates random samples and produces reconstructions of the real data, and the discriminator attempts to classify each true data point, sample, and reconstruction as being real, fake, or reconstructed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,It also proposes a user-facing interface with an interactive image editing algorithm along with various modifications to standard generative modeling architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,+ The IAN model itself is interesting as standard GAN-based approaches do not simultaneously train an autoencoder.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The writing is unclear at times and the mathematical formulation of the IAN is not very precise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,Many different ideas are proposed in the paper without sufficient empirical validation to characterize their individual contributions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"The photo editing interface, though interesting, is probably better suited for a conference with more of an HCI focus.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,* Section 2: The gradient descent step procedure seems to be quite similar to the approach proposed by [2].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,More elaboration on the differences would be helpful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,* Section 3: It is unclear whether the discriminator has three binary outputs or if there is a softmax over the three possible labels.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,The paper does not mention whether L_G and L_D are minimized or maximized.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Presumably they are both minimized, but in that case it is counter-intuitive that the generator attempts to decrease the probability that the discriminator assigns the ""real"" label to the generated samples and reconstructions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"In addition, in the minimization scenario L_D maximizes the probability of the correct labels being assigned to X_gen and \hat{X} but minimizes the probability of the ""real"" label being assigned to X.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"* Section 3.2: It is odd that not training MADE leads to better performance, as training MADE should lead to a better variational approximation to the true posterior.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,More exploration seems warranted here.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Overall, I am in the borderline mode, and may change my opinion depending on how the discussion phase goes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"1) The presented model combines elements of a large number of existing techniques: GAN, VAE, VAE/GAN (Lamb et al. 2016), inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), PixelRNN, ResNet, dilated convolutions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"In addition, the authors propose new modifications: orthogonal regularization (inspired by Saxe et al.), ternary discriminator in a GAN.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,This makes the overall architecture complicated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"An extensive ablation study could allow to judge about the effect of different components, but the ablation study presented in the paper is somewhat restricted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,What do we learn from the proposed architecture?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"What is important, what is not?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,Answering these question would significantly raise the potential impact of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"2) Related to the previous point, proper analysis requires adequate measures of performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Qualitative results are nice, but with the current surge of interest in generative models it gets very difficult to rely on qualitative evaluations: many methods produce visually similar results, and unless there is an obvious large jump in the quality of the produced images, it is unclear how to compare these.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,I do appreciate the effort authors have already put into evaluating the model: especially the keypoint error is interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Unfortunately, none of the presented measures evaluates visual quality of the images.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"A user study would be useful - I realize it is additional effort, but what is so restrictively difficult about it?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"Perhaps not with AMT, but with some fellow researchers/students.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,3) Work,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,[1] looks very related to the proposed visualization tool and deserves a more thorough discussion than a single sentence in the related work section.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"The paper by Zhu et al. appeared on arxiv more than 1,5 months before the ICLR deadline, and, more importantly, it has been published at ECCV before the ICLR deadline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,"This is unfortunate for the authors, but I think this makes the paper count as prior work, not concurrent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNKFiGex,In the end this is up to ACs and PCs to decide.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg,This seems not to be how the authors are using these terms.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg,Nor does it seem like there is a single consistent interpretation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg,The empirical results consist entirely of qualitative results (samples and reconstructions) from a single dataset (CelebA).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg,The samples are also not at all up to the quality of the SOTA models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryXZmzNeg,The interpolations shown in Figures 1 and 3 both seems to look like interpolation in pixel space for both the VAE model and the proposed DVAE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I agree with the other two reviewers that it is an interesting topic to investigate the feature learned by DML.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"For classification task though, I feel intuitively softmax should have advantages over distance metric learning method because the loss function is designed to assign the correct class for the given image.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"However, does it support the claim that softmax-based features work much better than DML learned features?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I have doubts on this claim.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Also the experiments are a little bit misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,What is vanilla googleNet softmax finetuned results?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,(softmax prob) result.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I am wondering whether the improvement comes from a) using retrieval (nearest neighbor) for classification or b) adding a new layer on top of pool5 or c) L2 normalization of the features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,It is not clear to me at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,It appears to me the comparison is not apple vs apple between the proposed method and Rippel et al.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I guess prior work claims to outperform SoftMax in these settings so this paper is fighting back against this and I should be thankful for this paper.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,This is a topic of particular relevance / interest to ICLR.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,This paper poses a simple yet provocative question: can a standard SoftMax based approach learn features that match or even outperform recent state-of-the-art DML approaches?,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Thorough experiments seem to indicate that this is indeed the case.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Comparisons are made to recent DML approaches including Magnet Loss (ICLR2016) and Lifted structure embedding (CVPR2016) and superior results are shown across a number of datasets / tasks for which the DML approaches were designed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"This main result is a bit surprising since SoftMax is a natural and trivial baseline, so it should have been properly evaluated in previous DML literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"The authors argue that previous approaches did not fully/properly tune the softmax baselines, or that comparisons were not apples-to-apples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Also, one change in the current paper is the addition of L2 normalization, which is well motivated and helps improve SoftMax feature distances.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Different dimensionality reduction approaches are also tested.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"These changes are minor, but especially the L2 normalization proves to be a simple but effective improvement for SoftMax features.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,A big issue is with how pre-training is performed (in Magnet Loss the softmax baselines were pretrained for less time on ImageNet).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"The approach taken here is reasonable, but so is the approach in Magnet Loss (for different reasons).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Ultimately, both are fine.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Unfortunately, due to use of different schemes, the results are not comparable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Let me copy-paste what I wrote in an earlier comment:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,My main concern about the paper is that the comparisons in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 4 to Rippel et al. are not apples-to-apples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Basically, the papers shows that absolute results of using SoftMax w full pre-training (PT) on ImageNet is superior to any of the results in Rippel's paper (including both the Softmax and Magnet results).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"But as the current results show, PT appears to be critical to obtaining such good numbers - The Rippel SoftMax numbers use only 3 PT stages and are dramatically worse than the full PT on ImageNet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"As it stands, I am not convinced that SoftMax is actually better than Magnet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Here is the evidence we have (I'll use Stanford Dogs as an example, but any of the datasets have the same conclusion): (1) Softmax w 3 stages of PT: 26.6% (from Rippel paper) and 32.7% (from authors' reproduction) (2) Magnet w 3 stages of PT: 24.9% (3) Softmax w full PT: 18.3% (4) Magnet w full PT: not shown From this all I see is that PT is critical for getting absolute good results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"However, what about Magnet w full PT?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,These results are not shown either here or in the original Rippel paper (I went back and looked).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"As such, I do not think it is justifiable to claim superiority of Softmax to Magnet based on available evidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"(Note: I looked back carefully at Rippel's paper, and it appears that the authors use 3 PT stages as a form of ""warmup"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"There is a statement that using full PT would ""defeat the purpose of pursuing DML"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"I'm not sure if I agree w Rippel's statement since in the present paper there is clear evidence that full PT is hugely helpful, at least for softmax.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"That being said, I did not see any evidence in the Rippel paper that PT is harmful or that DML wouldn't work with full PT.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"The authors responded to my concern by claiming that “from Rippel's results, it is no doubt that Magnet@3epochPT > Magnet@FullPT",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,and Magnet@3epoch > Softmax@3epochPT.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"However, I went back to Rippel’s paper, and simply the Magnet@FullPT experiment never appears.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"I further went and contacted Oren Rippel himself, and he verified he never ran the Magnet@FullPT experiment.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I encourage the authors to contact Oren Rippel regarding this if they wish to verify (I have asked Oren Rippel to not reveal my identity).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,[Disclaimer: I am NOT Oren Rippel].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,The authors mentioned that they are training Magnet@FullPT.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"If results were shown for Magnet@FullPT and also retrain the Magnet@3epochPT as a sanity check, that would help alleviate this concern.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Alternatively, the language in Section 4 and the Tables could be altered to make clear that the methods use different pretraining and hence are not comparable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"Overall, I am actually quite sympathetic to this work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I think it could serve as an important sanity-check paper for the community and quite relevant to ICLR.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,Having proper and strong SoftMax baselines should prove quite useful to the DML community and to this line of work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"However, currently I find the main results (table 1, table 2, figure 4, etc.) to be misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"If indeed it were the case that Magnet@3epochPT > Magnet@FullPT, then it would be fine.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"However, at this point as far as I know no one has actually tried Magnet@FullPT.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,"And, given the general importance and effectiveness of pre-training, especially when transferring to small dataset, I would be hugely surprised if Magnet@FullPT was not superior by a large margin.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQWFOVge,I think either having this experiment in place or altering the writing / presentation of the results would be critical to allow for publishing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,The paper proposes a semantic embedding based approach to multilabel classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"Conversely to previous proposals, SEM considers the underlying parameters determining the",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,observed labels are low-rank rather than that the observed label matrix is itself low-rank.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"However, It is not clear to what extent the difference between the two assumptions is significant",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,SEM models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"As such, it is a neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,The proposed training algorithm is slightly more complicated than vanilla backprop.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,The significance of the results compared to NNML (in particular on large datasets Delicious and EUrlex) is not very clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,The paper is well written and the main idea is clearly presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"However, the experimental results are not significant enough to compensate the lack of conceptual novelty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,The paper presents the semantic embedding model for multi-label prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"In my questions, I pointed that the proposed approach assumes the number of labels to predict is known, and the authors said this was an orthogonal question, although I don't think it is!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,I was trying to understand how different is SEM from a basic MLP with softmax output which would be trained with a two step approach instead of stochastic gradient descent.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,It seems reasonable given their similarity to compare to this very basic baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"Regarding the sampling strategy to estimate the posterior distribution, and the difference with Jean et al, I agree it is slightly different but I think you should definitely refer to it and point to the differences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"One last question: why is it called ""semantic"" embeddings?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"usually this term is used to show some semantic meaning between trained embeddings, but this doesn't seem to appear in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"This paper proposes SEM, a simple large-size multilabel learning algorithm which models the probability of each label as softmax(sigmoid(W^T X) + b), so a one-layer hidden network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"This in and of itself is not novel, nor is the idea of optimizing this by adagrad.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,Though it's weird that the paper explicitly derives the gradient and suggests doing alternating adagrad steps instead of the more standard adagrad steps; it's unclear whether this matters at all for performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"The main trick responsible for increasing the efficiency of this model is the candidate label sampling, which is done in a relatively standard way by sampling labels proportionally to their frequency in the dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,"Given that neither the model nor the training strategy is novel, it's surprising that the results are better than the state-of-the-art in quality and efficiency (though non-asymptotic efficiency claims are always questionable since implementation effort trades off fairly well against performance).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryAe2WBee,I feel like this paper doesn't quite meet the bar.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Apologies for the late review.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,This submission proposes method for class-conditional generative image modeling using auxiliary classifiers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Compared to normal GANs the generator also receives a randomly sampled class label c from the class distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"The discriminator has two outputs and two corresponding objectives: determine whether a sample is real or generated, and independently to predict the (real or sampled) class label corresponding to the sample.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Figure 2. nicely illustrates related methods - this particular method bears similarities to InfoGANs and Semi-supervised GANs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Compared to infogans, this method also encourages correspondence between the latent c and the real class labels for the real examples (whereas infogans are presented as fully unsupervised).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,The authors attempt at evaluating the method quantitatively by looking at the discriminability and diversity of samples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,It is found - not surprisingly - that higher resolution improves discriminability (because more information is present).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Discriminability: Figure 3 doesn’t have legends,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,so it is a bit hard to understand what is going on.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Furthermore, my understanding is that when evaluating discriminability the authors downsample and then bicubically upsample the image, which is much more like a blurring, very different from retraining all the models to work on low resolution in the first place.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Diversity: The authors try to quantitatively evaluate diversity of samples by measuring the average MS-SSIM between randomly selected pairs of points within each class.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"I think this method is significantly flawed and limited, for reasons mentioned in (Theis et al, 2015, A note on the evaluation…).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"In its behaviour, MS-SSIM is not that dissimilar from Euclidean distance - although it is nonlinear and is bounded between -1 and 1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Evaluating diversity/entropy of samples in high dimensions is very hard, especially if the distributions involved are non-trivial for example concentrated around manifolds.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Consider for example a generative model which randomly samples just two images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Assuming that the MSSSIM between these two images is -1, this generative model can easily achieve an average MSSSIM score of 0, implying a conclusion that this model has more diversity than the training data itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Conversely, SSIM is designed not to be sensitive to contrast and average pixel intensity, so if a model is diverse in this sense, that will be ignored by this measure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Overall, the paper proposes a new way to incorporate class labels into training GAN-type models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"As far as I know the particular algorithm is novel, but I consider it incremental compared to what has been done before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"I think the proposed evaluation metrics are flawed, especially when evaluating the diversity of the samples for the aforementioned reasons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"This is a clear, easy to read, highly relevant paper that improves GAN training for images and explores evaluation criterion on GANs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,The main contributions are as follows:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Adding an auxiliary classifier head to a GAN discriminator and training a classification objective in addition to the real/fake objective improves performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Generator is conditioned on 1-hot encoding of class and is trained to generate the specified class.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Training different models on different subsets of imagenet classes improves performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,They motivate evaluating GAN images by using a perceptual similarity metric (MS-SSIM) on pairs of samples to quantify diversity in the samples (and detect mode collapse),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,They show this metric correlates with a discriminability metric (classification accuracy of pre-trained imagenet model on generated samples) .,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,The overall novelty of this approach is somewhat lacking in that previous methods have proposed training a classifier head on the discriminator and the discriminability metric proposed is simply the inception score of [1] except with class information.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"However, I think there is still a contribution to be made my putting these tricks together and successfully demonstrating image synthesis gains.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Questions for the authors:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,(1) Why do you think splitting the imagenet training into 100 different models improves performance?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Is the issue with the representation of the class?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"In other words, if an encoding more meaningful that 1-hot vector was used do you still think 100 models would be needed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Ideally we should hope that a generative model can leverage information from different classes to help with the generation of a particular class and also text-image synthesis models [2] have been quite successful when trained on diverse datasets (and these are conditioned on a semantically meaningful text encoding) which suggests to be that the issue is with the representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,(2) In section 3 the AC-GAN classification objective (omitting expectation for brevity) is given as L_S = log P(C=c|X_real) + log P(C=c|X_fake) and you say that both the discriminator and generator are trained to maximize this quantity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Obviously the generator would want to maximize  log P(C=c|X_fake) for its given conditioning class c.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,But can you explain why you would want the discriminator to also maximize the classification accuracy of generated samples?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Why not do something similar to the CatGAN paper,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,[3] and train the discriminator to be as uncertain as possible about the generated examples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,Seems counterintuitive to me to have both the generator and discriminator trying to optimize the same classification objective rather than not be adversarial wrt to this loss as well as the real/fake loss.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXTf9Bxg,"Overall, this paper makes a clear contribution to GAN research both in terms of image quality and evaluation metrics and I would recommend it for acceptance.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,"More generally, the intention of the driver seems more related to the goals they are pursuing at the moment; there is a fair amount of work in inverse reinforcement learning that examines this problem (some of it in the context of driving style as well).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,This paper proposes a neural network architecture for car state prediction while driving based on competitive learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,Competitive learning creates several duplicates of the baseline neural architecture and during training only updates the architecture with minimum loss.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,The paper is understandable but could benefit from some copy editing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,The competitive learning approach seems rather adhoc and this paper feels quite incomplete without significant discussion and comparisons to ensembling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,"Much recent work has shown that duplicating and ensembling neural architectures can produce gains, and it’s not clear why competitive learning is better than ensembling, it seems less theoretically sound to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,There is a huge confound in the experiments due to the competitive learning architecture having many more free parameters than the baseline architecture.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkqMSCHxe,Again I think comparing to ensembling with the same number of architectures duplicated and perhaps comparing to a single baseline with larger hidden layers to make the total number of free parameters comparable is critical to validating the proposed approach.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1RP6GLle,Can this framework perform well on images with larger size?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,CONS,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,I still have not read the revision and maybe you have already addressed some of these points there.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,"The problem statement is close to that from [Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio NIPS 2014], which specifically arrives at exponential gaps between deep and shallow ReLU networks, albeit from a different angle.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,I would suggest to include that paper it in the overview.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,The arguments and proofs are easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,I only have two questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,1- It would be great to have similar results without binary step units.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,To what extent do you find the binary step unit central to the proof?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,2- Is there an example of piecewise smooth function that requires at least poly(1/eps) hidden units with a shallow network?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,The paper is well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,"The technical content, including the proofs in the Appendix, look correct.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,"Although the proof techniques are simple (and are sometimes modifications of arguments by Gil, Telgarsky, or Dasgupta), they are brought together in a coherent manner to produce sharp results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkpSlKIel,"Therefore, I am leaning toward acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"This paper was easy to read, the main idea was presented very clearly.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,The main points of the paper (and my concerns are below) can be summarized as follows:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"1. synchronous algoriths suffer from some struggeling nodes, for which the algorithm has to wait. From my own experience, this has never happend for me on e.g. Amazon EC2 cloud, however, it happens on our own cluster at my university, if the cluster is shared and some users make some nodes very busy. So maybe if the nodes would be dedicated to just user's job, it wouldn't be such a big concer (I am not sure what kind of cluster was used to produce Figure 3 and 4). Also how many experiments have you run? In my own experience, most of the time I get the gradient on time from all nodes equality fast, but maybe just in less than 0.1% of iterations I observe that it took maybe twice as long for some node. Also the increasing shape of the curve is somehow implying some weird implementation of communication. Isn't it only because you are somehow serialize the communication? And it would be maybe much faster if a ""MPI_Reduce"" would be used (even if we wait for the slowest guy)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"2. asynchronous algorithms are cutting the waiting time, however, the convergence speed may be slower. Moreover, those algorithms can be divergence it special care is not given to stale gradients. Also they have a nice guarantees for convex functions, but the non-convex DNN may cause pain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"3.they propose to take gradient from the first ""N"" workers out of ""N+b""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,workers available.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,My concern here is that they focused only on the,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"workers, but what if the ""parameter server"" will became to slow?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,What,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,if the parameter server would be the bottleneck?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,How would you address,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,this situation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"But still if the number of nodes (N) is not large, and",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"the deep DNN is used, I can imagine that the communciation will not",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,take more than 30% of the run-time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,My largest concern is with the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,Different batch size,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"implies that different learning rate should be chosen, right?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,How did,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,you tune the learning rates and other parameters for e.g. Figure 5 you,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"provide some formulas in (A2) but clearly this can bias your Figures,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,right?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"meaning, that if you tune ""\gamma, \beta"" for each N,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,it could,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,be somehow more representative?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,also it would be nicer if you run the,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"experiment many times and then report average, best and worst case",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,behaviour.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"because now it can be just coinsidence, right?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,This paper proposed a synchronous parallel SGD by employing several backup machines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"The parameter server does not have to wait for the return from all machines to perform the update on the model, which reduce the synchronization overhead.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,It sounds like a reasonable and straightforward idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"My main concern is that this approach is only suitable for some very specific scenario, that is, most learners (except a small number of learners) are at the same pace to return the results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"If the efficiency of learners does not follow such distribution, I do not think that the proposed algorithm will work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,So I suggest two revisions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,provide more experiments to show the performance with different efficiency distributions of learners.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,assuming that all learners follow the same distribution of efficiency and show the expected idle time is minor by using the proposed algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"The paper claim that, when supported by a number of backup workers, synchronized-SGD",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,actually works better than async-SGD.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"The idea is very simple, but in practice it can be quite useful in industry settings where",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,adding some backup workders is not a big problem in cost.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"Nevertheless, I think the",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,proposed solution is quite straightforward to come up with when we assume that,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,each worker contains the full dataset and we have budge to add more workers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"So,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"under this setting, it seems quite natural to have a better performance with the additional",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,backup workers that avoid the staggering worker problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"And, with this assumtion I'm not",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,sure if the proposed solution is solving difficult enough problem with novel enough idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"In the experiments, for fair comparison, I think the Async-SGD should also have a mechanism",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,to cut off updates of too much staledness just as the proposed method ignores all the remaining,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,updates after having N updates.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,"For example, one can measure the average time spent to",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,obtain N updates in sync-SGD setting and use that time as the cut-off threashold in Async-SGD,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAddcLge,so that Async-SGD does not perform so poorly.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,Finally the embedding of the used input is update by a WRITE function (an LSTM working that takes hidden state of the other LSTM as an input).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,The model has a discrete component (the SEARCH) and is thus trained with REINFORCE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"In the experimental section they test their approach on several algorithmic tasks such as search, sort...",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"The main advantage of replacing the full softmax by a hierarchical softmax is that during inference, the complexity goes from O(N) to O(log(N)).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,It would be great to see if the gain in complexity allows to tackle problem which are a few orders of magnitude bigger than the one addressed with full softmax.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"However the authors only test on toy sequences up to 32 tokens, which is quite small.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"Overall, while the idea of replacing the softmax in the attention mechanism by a hierachical softmax is appealing, this work is not quite convincing yet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"Their approach is not very natural, may be hard to train and may not be that simple to scale.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,The experiment section is very weak.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,The paper is well written and everything is clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,* It's a new model and I'm not aware of a similar model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,* It's clear that memory access time is an issue for longer sequences and it is clear how this model solves this problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,The motivation for O(log n) access time is to be able to use the model on very long sequences.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"While it is clear from the definition that the computation time is low because of its design, it is not clear that the model will really generalize well to very long sequences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,The model was also not tested on any real-world task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkfiXiUlg,"I think such experiments should be added to show whether the model really works on long sequences and real-world tasks, otherwise it is not clear if this is a useful model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,The paper is well motivated and well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,The setting of the experiments is to investigate a particular case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"While the results of experiments are interesting, such investigation is not likely to systematically improve our understanding of the adversarial example phenomenon.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"Overall, the contribution of the paper seems incremental.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"1. This paper proposes the iterative LL method, which is efficient in both computation and success rate in generating adversarial examples. This method could be useful when the number of classes in the dataset is huge.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"2. Some observations of the experiments are interesting. For example, overall photo transformation does not affect much the accuracy on clean image, but could destroy some adversarial methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"1. As noticed by the authors, some similar works exist in the literature. According to the authors, what differs this work from other existing works is that this paper tend to fool NN by making very small perturbations of the input. But based on the experiments and the demonstration (the real pictures), it is arguable that the perturbations in the experiments are still small.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,2. Some hypotheses proposed in the paper based on one-shot experiments seems too rushy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"3. As mentioned above, the results of this paper seems not really improving the understanding of the adversarial example phenomenon.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"In some sense, the Sharif et al. work ""scooped"" this paper, but as the authors indicate, the spirit of the work remains somewhat different.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Sharif's approach was constrained in an interesting way (usable surface area limited to front portion of glasses frames) and also a bit gimmicky (focused on fooling a small scale face ID system to select among a set of celebrities).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,The present work is less sensational and more methodical in its study of physical manifestations of adversarial patterns for standard benchmark objects.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,I think the paper is at least a little above the bar since it poses an interesting question and carries out an informative empirical study.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Description.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"The paper investigates whether adversarial examples survive different geometric and photometric image transformations,",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,including a complex transformation where the image is printed on the paper and captured again by a cell-phone camera.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,The paper considers three different methods to generate adversarial examples — images with added small amount of noise that changes the output of a classification neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,In the quantitative experiments the paper assumes available access to the neural network and its parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Qualitative results are shown for a set-up where the network used to generate adversarial images is different from the test network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Strong  points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,adversarial examples are an interesting phenomenon that is worth detailed investigation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,the paper is well written and presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Results showing (and quantifying) that adversarial examples can survive a complex image transformation such as printing and re-capturing are interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Experiments are well done and solid.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Weak points:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Probably the main negative point is the amount of novelty and contribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,The paper essentially presents a set of experiments evaluating whether adversarial examples survive different image transformations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Apart from that there is no other main contribution / novelty.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,"While the experiments are solid and well-done, this seems borderline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Detailed evaluation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Originality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,the main contribution of this work is the experimental evaluation showing (and quantifying) how adversarial examples behave under various image transformations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Quality:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1OufnIlx,Not sure if contribution is significant enough.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The paper addresses the problem of learning compact binary data representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,I have a hard time understanding the setting and the writing of the paper is not making it any easier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,For example I can't find a simple explanation of the problem and I am not familiar with these line of research.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,I read all the responses provided by authors to reviewer's questions and re-read the paper again and I still do not fully understand the setting and thus can't really evaluate the contributions of these work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The related work section does not exist and instead the analysis of the literature is somehow scattered across the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,There are no derivations provided.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"Statements often miss references, e.g. the ones in the fourth paragraph of Section 3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,This makes me conclude that the paper still requires significant work before it can be published.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The goal of this paper is to learn “ a collection of experts that are individually,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,meaningful and that have disjoint responsibilities.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"Unlike a standard mixture model, they “use a different mixture for each dimension d.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"While the results seem promising, the paper exposition needs significant improvement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The paper jumps in with no motivation at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"What is the application, or even the algorithm, or architecture that this is used for?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,This should be addressed at the beginning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The subsequent exposition is not very clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"There are assertions made with no justification, e.g. “the experts only have a small variance for some subset of the variables while the variance of the other variables is large.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"Since you’re learning both the experts and the weights, can this be rephrased in terms of dictionary learning?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,Please discuss the relevant related literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"The horse data set is quite small with respect to the feature dimension, and so the conclusions may not necessarily generalize.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,This paper proposes a new kind of expert model where a sparse subset of most reliable experts is chosen instead of the usual logarithmic opinion pool of a PoE.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,I find the paper very unclear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"I tried to find a proper definition of the joint model p(x,z) but could not extract this from the text.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The proposed “EM-like” algorithm should then also follow directly from this definition.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,At this point I do not see if such as definition even exists.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"In other words, is there is an objective function on which the iterates of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to improve on the train data?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,We also note that the “product of unifac models” from Hinton tries to do something very similar where only a subset of the experts will get activated to generate the input: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/tr00-004.pdf,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,I tried to derive the update rule on top of page 4 from the “conditional objective for p(x|h)” in sec. 3.2,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,But I am getting something different (apart form the extra smoothing factors eps and mu_o).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,Does this follow?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,"(If we define R=R_nk, mu-mu_k and X=X_n, I get mu = (XR)*inv(R^TR) as the optimal solution, which then needs to be projected back onto the probability simplex).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,The experiments are only illustrative.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,They don’t compare with other methods (such as an RBM or VAE) nor do they give any quantitative results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,We are left with eyeballing some images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ46w6Ule,I have no idea whether what we see is impressive or not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,This paper presents a linear pipeline All-reduce approach for parallel neural networks on multiple GPU.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The paper provides both theoretical analysis and experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"Overall, the results presented in the paper are interesting, but the writing can be improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The authors compare their proposed approach with several alternative approaches and demonstrate strong performance of the proposed approaches.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,But it is unclear if the improvement is from the proposed approach or from the implementation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The paper is not easy to follow and the writing can be improved in many place (aside from typos and missing references).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"Specifically, the authors should provide more intuitions of the proposed approach in the introduction and in Section 3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"The proposition and the analysis in Section 3.2 do not suggest the communication cost of linear pipeline is approximately 2x and log p faster than BE and MST, respectively, as claimed in many places in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"Instead, it suggests LP *cannot* be faster than these methods by 2x and log p  times.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"More specifically, Eq (2) shows T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP < 2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,This does not provide an upper-bound of T_broadcase_LP and it can be arbitrary worse when comparing with T_broadcase_BE from this inequality.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"Therefore, instead of showing T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP < 2, the authors should state T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP > 1 when n approaches infinity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,It would be interesting to emphasize more on the differences between designing parallel algorithms on CPU v.s. on GPU to motivate the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,This paper analyzes the ring-based AllReduce approach for multi-GPU data parallel training of deep net.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,Comments,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"1) The name linear pipeline is somewhat confusing to the readers, as the technique is usually referred as ring based approach in Allreduce literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The author should use the standard name to make the connection easier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,2) The cost analysis of ring-based Allreduce is already provided in the existing literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"This paper applied the analysis to the case of multi-GPU deep net training, and concluded that the scaling is invariant of number of GPUs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,3),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"The ring-based allreduce approach is already supported by NVidia’s NCCL library, although the authors claim that their implementation comes earlier than the NCCL implementation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,4) The overlap of communication of computation is an already applied technique in systems such as TensorFlow and MXNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"The schedule proposed by the authors exploits the overlap partially, doing backprop of t-1 while doing reduce.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,Note that the dependency pattern can be further exploited; with the forward of layer t depend on update of parameter of layer t in last iteration.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,This can be done by a dependency scheduler.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"5) Since this paper is about analysis of Allreduce, it would be nice to include detailed analysis of tree-shape reduction, ring-based approach and all-to-all approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The discussion of all-to-all approach is missing in the current paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"In summary, this is a paper discussed existing Allreduce techniques for data parallel multi-GPU training of deep net, with cost analysis based on existing results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,"While I personally find the claimed result not surprising as it follows from existing analysis of Allreduce, the analysis might help some other readers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,I view this as a baseline paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzuKpLgg,The analysis of Allreduce could also been improved (see comment 5).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,This paper conducts a comprehensive series of experiments on vocabulary selection strategies to reduce the computational cost of neural machine translation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"A range of techniques are investigated, ranging from very simple methods such as word co-occurences, to the relatively complex use of SVMs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"The experiments are solid, comprehensive and very useful in practical terms.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,It is good to see that the best vocabulary selection method is very effective at achieving a very high proportion of the coverage of the full-vocabulary model (fig 3).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"However, I feel that the experiments in section 4.3 (vocabulary selection during training) was rather limited in their scope - I would have liked to see more experiments here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,A major criticism I have with this paper is that there is little novelty here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"The techniques are mostly standard methods and rather simple, and in particular, there it seems that there is not much additional material beyond the work of Mi et al (2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"So although the work is solid, the lack of originality lets it down.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"Minor comments: in 2.1, the word co-occurence measure - was any smoothing used to make this measure more robust to low counts?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,This paper compares several strategies for guessing a short list of vocabulary for the target language in neural machine translation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,The primary findings are that word alignment dictionaries work better than a variety of other techniques.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"My take on this paper is that to have a significant impact, it needs to make the case for why one might want vocabulary rather than characters or sub word units like BPE.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"I think there are likely many very good reasons to do this that could be argued for (synthesize morphology, deal with transliteration, etc), but most of these would suggest some particular models and experiments, which are of course not in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"As it is, I think this paper is a useful but minor contribution that shows that word alignment is a good way of getting short lists, but it does not strongly make the case that we should abandon work in other directions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"In addition to the SVM approach for modeling vocabulary, the discriminative word lexicon of Mauser et al. (2009) and the neural version of Ha et al. (2014) are also worth mentioning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,It would be useful to know what the coverage rate of the actual full vocabulary would be (rather than the 100k “full vocabulary”).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,Since presumably this technique could be used to work with much larger vocabularies.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"When reducing the vocabulary size for training, the Mi et al. (2016) technique of taking the union of all the vocabularies in a mini batch seems like a rather strange objective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"If the vocabulary of a single sentence is used, the probabilistic semantics of the translation model can still be preserved since p(e | f, vocab(f))",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,= p(e | f),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,if p(vocab(f) | f),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"= 1, i.e., is deterministic, which it is here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,Whereas the objective is no longer a sensible probability model in the mini batch vocabulary case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"Thus, while it may be a bit more difficult to implement, it seems like it would at least be a sensible comparison to make.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"In this paper, the authors present several strategies to select a small subset of target vocabulary to work with per source sentence, which results in significant speedup.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,The results are convincing and I think this paper offers practical values to general seq2seq approaches to language tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"However, there is little novelty in this work: the authors further mostly extend the work of (Mi et al., 2016) with more vocabulary selection strategies and thorough experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,This paper will fit better in an NLP venue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,This paper evaluates several strategies to reduce output vocabulary size in order to speed up NMT decoding and training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"It could be quite useful to practitioners, although the main contributions of the paper seem somewhat orthogonal to representation learning and neural networks, and I am not sure ICLR is the ideal venue for this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,Do the reported decoding times take into account the vocabulary reduction step?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,"Aside from machine translation, might there be applications to other settings such as language modeling, where large vocabulary is also a scalability challenge?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,The proposed methods are helpful because of the difficulties induced by using a word-level model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8N0RLxx,But (at least in my opinion) starting from a character or even lower-level abstraction seems to be the obvious solution to the huge vocabulary problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Use of ML in ITP is an interesting direction of research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Authors consider the problem of predicting whether a given statement would be useful in a proof of a conjecture or not.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,This is posed as a binary classification task and authors propose a dataset and some deep learning based baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"I am not an expert on ITP or theorem proving, so I will present a review from more of a ML perspective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,I feel one of the goals of the paper should be to present the problem to a ML audience in a way that is easy for them to grasp.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"While most of the paper is well written, there are some sections that are not clear (especially section 2):",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"Terms such as LCF, OCaml-top level, deBruijn indices have been used without explaining or any references.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"These terms might be trivial in ITP literature, but were hard for me to follow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Section 2 describes how the data was splits into train and test set.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,One thing which is unclear is – can the examples in the train and test set be statements about the same conjecture or are they always statements about different conjectures?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,It also unclear how the deep learning models are applied.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Let’s consider the leftmost architecture in Figure 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Each character is embedded into 256-D vector – and processed until the global max-pooling layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Does this layer take a max along each feature and across all characters in the input?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,My another concern is only deep learning methods are presented as baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,It would be great to compare with standard NLP techniques such as Bag of Words followed by SVM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"I am sure these would be outperformed by neural networks, but the numbers would give a sense of how easy/hard the current problem setup is.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Did the authors look at the success and failure cases of the algorithm?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Are there any insights that can be drawn from such analysis that can inform design of future models?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Overall I think the research direction of using ML for theorem proving is an interesting one.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"However, I also feel the paper is quite opaque.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Many parts of how the data is constructed is unclear (atleast to someone with little knowledge in ITPs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,If authors can revise the text to make it clearer – it would be great.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"The baseline models seem to perform quite well, however there are no insights into what kind of ability the models are lacking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Authors mention that they are unable to perform logical reasoning – but that’s a very vague statement.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Some examples of mistakes might help make the message clearer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"Further, since I am not well versed with the ITP literature it’s not possible for me to judge how valuable is this dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"From the references, it seems like it’s drawn from a set of benchmark conjectures/proofs used in the ITP community – so its possibly a good dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"My current rating is a weak reject, but if the authors address my concerns I would change to an accept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"The authors present a dataset extraction method, dataset and first interesting results for machine-learning supported higher order logic theorem proving.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"The experimental results are impressively good for a first baseline and with an accuracy higher than 0.83 in relevance classification a lot better than chance, and encourage future research in this direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,The paper is well-written in terms of presentation and argumentation and leaves little room for criticism.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"The related work seems to be well-covered, though I have to note that I am not an expert for automated theorem proving.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,The authors describe a dataset of proof steps in higher order logic derived from a set of proven theorems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,"The success of methods like AlphaGo suggests that for hard combinatorial style problems, having a curated set of expert data (in this case the sequence of subproofs) is a good launching point for possibly super-human performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,Super-human ATPs are clearly extremely valuable.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,It would be great to see future work scale up the baselines and integrate the networks into state of the art ATPs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryuxYmvel,The capacity of deep learning methods to scale and take advantage of larger datasets means there's a possibility of an iterative approach to improving ATPs: as the ATPs get stronger they may generate more data in the form of new theorems.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByOK0rwlx,"My major criticisms are three-fold: for one, the results are not compared to one of the many other pruning methods that are described in section 1.1, and as such the performance of the method is difficult to judge from the paper alone.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"This paper introduces a maximum total correlation procedure, adds a target and then adds noise perturbations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,Technical issues:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,The move from (1) to (2) is problematic.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"Yes it is a lower bound, but by igoring H(Z), equation (2) ignores the fact that H(Z) will potentially vary more significantly that H(Z|Y).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"As a result of removing H(Z), the objective (2) encourages Z that are low entropy as the H(Z) term is ignored, doubly so as low entropy Z results in low entropy Z|Y.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"Yes the -H(X|Z) mitigates against a complete entropy collapse for H(Z), but it still neglects critical terms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"In fact one might wonder if this is the reason that semantic noise addition needs to be done anyway, just to push up the entropy of Z to stop it reducing too much.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,In (3) arbitrary balancing paramters lamda_1 and lambda_2 are introduced ex-nihilo - they were not there in (2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,This is not ever justified.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"Then in (5), a further choice is made by simply adding L_{NLL} to the objective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"But in the supervised case, the targets are known and so turn up in H(Z|Y).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,Hence now H(Z|Y) should be conditioned on the targets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"However instead another objective is added again without justification, and the conditional entropy of Z is left disconnected from the data it is to be conditioned on.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"One might argue the C(X,Y,Z) simply acts as a prior on the networks (and hence implicitly on the weights) that we consider, which is then combined with a likelihood term, but this case is not made.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,In fact there is no explicit probabilistic or information theoretic motivation for the chosen objective.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"Given these issues, it is then not too surprising that some further things need to be done, such as semantic noise addition to actually get things working properly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"It may be the form of noise addition is a good idea, but given the troublesome objective being used in the first place, it is very hard to draw conclusions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyCSsUDee,"In summary, substantially better theoretical justification of the chosen model is needed, before any reasonable conclusion on the semantic noise modelling can be made.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,This paper addresses the problem of achieving differential privacy in a very general scenario where a set of teachers is trained on disjoint subsets of sensitive data and the student performs prediction based on public data labeled by teachers through noisy voting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,I found the approach altogether plausible and very clearly explained by the authors.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"A simple idea of adding perturbation error to the counts, known from differentially-private literature, is nicely re-used by the authors and elegantly applied in a much broader (non-convex setting) and practical context than in a number of differentially-private and other related papers.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,This paper discusses how to guarantee privacy for training data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"In the proposed approach multiple models trained with disjoint datasets are used as ``teachers'' model, which will train a ``student'' model to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,The theoretical results are nice but also intuitive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"Since teachers' result are provided via noisy voting, the student model may not duplicate the teacher's behavior.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"However, the probabilistic bound has quite a number of  empirical parameters, which makes me difficult to decide whether the security is 100% guaranteed or not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,The experiments on MNIST and SVHN are good.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,Another caveat is that the reported epsilons are not those that can be privately released; the authors note that their technique for doing so would change the resulting epsilon.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,“all teachers….get the same training data….”,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,the same teacher on the neighboring database.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,4.1: The authors state: “The number n of teachers is limited by a trade-off between the classification task’s complexity and the available data.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"However, since this tradeoff is not formalized, the statement is imprecise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"In particular, if the analysis is done in the i.i.d. setting, the tradeoff would also likely depend on the relation of the target hypothesis to the data distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,Discussion of figure 3 was rather unclear in the text and caption and should be revised for clarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"In the text section, at first the explanation seems to imply that a larger gap is better (as is also indicated in the caption).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,However later it is stated that the gap stays under 20%.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg,"These sentences seem contradictory, which is likely not what was intended.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAbMKwxe,"The paper analyses the misclassification error of discriminators and highlights the fact that while uniform probability prior of the classes makes sense early in the optimization, the distribution deviates from this prior significantly as the parameters move away from the initial values.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAbMKwxe,"The reason why I am confused is that ""The standard approach to supervised classification"", as is mentioned in the abstract, is to use deterministic classifiers at test time, and the log-loss (up to constants) is an upper bound on the classification error of the deterministic classifier.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAbMKwxe,"As far as I can see, there are two cases: either (i) the paper deals with learning randomized classifiers, in which case it should compare the performances with the deterministic counterparts that people use in practice, or (ii) the paper makes sense as soon as we accept that the optimization of criterion (a) is a good surrogate for (b).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyAbMKwxe,"In both cases,  I think the write-up should be made clearer (because in case (ii) the algorithm does not minimize an upper bound on the classification error, and in case (i) what is done does not correspond to what is usually done in binary classification).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,That is unless there is a specific reason that an iterative approach can be shown to converge to a better solution when run over several epochs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,This paper does not convince me on these points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,"Indeed, unsurprisingly, the authors note that ""the probability of correctly labelling a word as a mistake remains low (62%)"" - this admittedly beats a random-chance baseline, but is not compared to something more meaningful, such as simply contrasting the existing system with a more powerful convolutional model and labelling all discrepancies as mistakes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,"The oracle experiments are rather meaningless - they just serve to confirm that improving a translation is very easy when the existing mistakes have been identified, but much harder when they are not.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,"While I think this is a reasonable assumption than can be made for the sake of tractability, it is very unfortunate since missing or extra words (esp. function words) are a common problem in the baseline models that are being used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1y1aawlg,"Second, the standard objections to absolute positional models (vs. relative positional models) seem particularly crucial to bring up in this work, especially since they might make some of the design decisions a bit more justifiable.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,This research uses tools from literature from the '90s (I haven't seen the abbreviation ANN (page 3) for a long time) and does not build on modern techniques which have advanced a lot since then.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,I would encourage the authors to review modern literature and continue working on this important task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,Thank you for an interesting read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,"To my knowledge, very few papers have looked at transfer learning with **no** target domain data (the authors called this task as ""extrapolation"").",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,This paper clearly shows that the knowledge of the underlying system dynamics is crucial in this case.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,The experiments clearly showed the promising potential of the proposed EQL model.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,Quesions and comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,"1. Multiplication units. By the universal approximation theorem, multiplication can also be represented by a neural network in the usual sense. I agree with the authors' explanation of interpolation and extrapolation, but I still don't quite understand why multiplication unit is crucial here. I guess is it because this representation generalises better when training data is not that representative for the future?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,2. Fitting an EQL vs. fitting a polynomial. It seems to me that the number of layers in EQL has some connections to the degree of the polynomial. Assume we know the underlying dynamics we want to learn can be represented by a polynomial. Then what's the difference between fitting a polynomial (with model selection techniques to determine the degree) and fitting an EQL (with model selection techniques to determine the number of layers)? Also your experiments showed that the selection of basis functions (specific to the underlying dynamics you want to learn) is crucial for the performance. This means you need to have some prior knowledge on the form of the equation anyway!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,3. Ben-David et al. 2010 has presented some error bounds for the hypothesis that is trained on source data but tested on the target data. I wonder if your EQL model can achieve better error bounds?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUPiRvge,4. Can you comment on the comparison of your method to those who modelled the extrapolation data with **uncertainty**?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kGbydxg,Is it not possible that the only reason proportional control is a little better is that the tracking cost is a function of positions?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kGbydxg,My suggestion is to vary the number of neurons or show that the same results hold for a different state representation (e.g. trained on pixel data).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,"For the visualization tools, there are also no quantitative evaluation, maybe these results are more art than science.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,In this paper the authors propose various techniques to sample visualizations from generative models with high dimensional latent spaces like VAEs and GANs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,"For example, the authors highlight the well known but often not sufficiently appreciated fact that the probability mass of high dimensional Gaussian distributions concentrates near a thin hyper-shell with a certain radius.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,They therefore propose to use spherical interpolations (great arcs) instead of the commonly used linear interpolations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,In a similar spirit they propose a visualisation for analogies and techniques to reinforce structure in VAE latent spaces.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,I find it hard to give clear recommendation for this paper: On the one hand I enjoyed reading it and I might want use some of the proposals (e.g. spherical interpolations; J-diagrams) in future work of mine.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SypU81Ole,"On the other hand, it’s obvious that this paper is not a typical machine learning paper; it does not propose a new model, or training method, or provide (theoretical/empirical) insight and it does not have the scientific quality and depth I’ve seen in many other ICLR submissions.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJNDWNOlg,"This demonstrates that in spite of insufficient training data, training is still possible and beneficial.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,That feels a little misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,This paper tries to leverage an external lexicon / knowledge base to improve corpus-based word representations by determining (in a fuzzy way) which potential paraphrase is the most appropriate in a particular context.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,What have we learned about word representations / lexicons / corpus-based methods in general?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy paraphrases to aid in the learning of distributed word representations from a corpus augmented by a lexicon or ontology.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"The main argumentation leading to the model selection is intuitive, and I believe that the inclusion of good paraphrases and the elimination of bad paraphrases during training should in principle improve word representation quality.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"However, the main questions are how well the proposed method achieves this goal, and, even if it achieves it well, whether it makes much difference in practical terms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"Regarding the first question, I am not entirely convinced that the parameterization of the control function f(x_ij) is optimal.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"It would have been nice to see some experiments investigating different choices, in particular some baselines where the effect of f is diminished (so that it reduces to f=1 in the limit) would have been interesting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"I also feel like there would be a lot to gain from having f be a function of the nearby word embeddings, though this would obvious incur a significant slowdown.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"(See for example 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should probably be cited.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"As it stands, the experimental results do not clearly distinguish the fuzzy paraphrase approach from prior work, i.e. tables 3 and 4 do not show major trends one way or the other.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1osyr_xg,"Regarding the second question, it is hard to draw many conclusions from analogy tasks alone, especially when effects unrelated to good/bad paraphrasing such as corpus size/content, window size, vocabulary size, etc., can have an outsize effect on performance.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"For example, quoting from Section 1:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"“Rather than relying on the RNN hidden state to decide when to use the pointer, as in the recent work of Gulcehre et al. (2016), we allow the pointer component itself to decide when to use the softmax vocabulary through a sentinel.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"As far as I can tell, your model also uses the recent hidden state to form a query vector,  which is matched by the pointer network to previous words.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,Can you please clarify what you mean here?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"In addition, quoting from section 3 which describes the model of Gulcehre et al.:",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,“The pointer network is not used as a source of information for the switching network as in our model.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,It is not clear what the authors mean by “source of information” here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,Is it the fact that the switching probability is part of the pointer softmax?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,I am wondering how significant this difference is.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"With regards to the proposed dataset, there are also other datasets typically used for language modelling, including The Hutter Prize Wikipedia (enwik8) dataset (Hutter, 2012) and e Text8 dataset (Mahoney, 2009).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"I would be happy to discuss with the authors the points I raised, and I am open to changing my vote if there is any misunderstanding on my part.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,This work is basically a combined pointer network applied on language modelling.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"The smart point is that this paper aims at language modelling with longer context, where a memory of seen words (especially the rare words) would be very useful for predicting the rest of the sentences.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"I would be interested in the variations of sentinel mixture implementation, though the current version has achieved very good results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"In addition, the new WikiText language modelling dataset is very interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,It probably can be a more standard dataset for evaluating the continuously-updated language model benchmarks than ptb dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,"Overall, this is a well-written paper.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,A comment regarding notation:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,The symbol p_ptr is used in two different ways in eq. 3 and eq. 5. : p_ptr(w) vs. p_ptr(y_i|x_i),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,This is confusing as these are two different domains: for eq 3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,the domain is a *set* of words and for eq. 5,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,the domain is a *list* of context words.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe,It would be helpful to use different symbol for the two objects.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,I recommend acceptance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,One minor red flag:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,"The massive drop in CBOW performance in Figures 1b and 4b are not explained, and seem implausible enough to warrant serious further investigation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,Can you be absolutely certain that those results would appear with a different codebase and different random seed implementing the same model?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,"Fortunately, this point is largely orthogonal to the major results of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,Two writing comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,"I agree that the results with word order and CBOW are surprising, but I think it's slightly misleading to say that CBOW is predictive of word order.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,"It doesn't represent word order at all, but it's possible to probabilistically reconstruct word order from the information that it does encode.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,"Saying that ""LSTM auto-encoders are more effective at encoding word order than word content"" doesn't really make sense.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJh6Ztuxl,These two quantities aren't comparable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,This paper proposes to learn groups of orthogonal features in a convnet by penalizing correlation among features in each group.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"The technique is applied in the setting of image classification with “privileged information” in the form of foreground segmentation masks, where the model is trained to learn orthogonal groups of foreground and background features using the correlation penalty and an additional “background suppression” term.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Proposes a “group-wise model diversity” loss term which is novel, to my knowledge.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The use of foreground segmentation masks to improve image classification is also novel.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The method is evaluated on two standard and relatively large-scale vision datasets: ImageNet and PASCAL VOC 2012.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The evaluation is lacking.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"There should be a baseline that leaves out the background suppression term, so readers know how much that term is contributing to the performance vs. the group orthogonal term.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The use of the background suppression term is also confusing to me,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"it seems redundant, as the group orthogonality term should already serve to suppress the use of background features by the foreground feature extractor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,It would be nice to see the results with “Incomplete Privileged Information” on the full ImageNet dataset (rather than just 10% of it) with the privileged information included for the 10% of images where it’s available.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,This would verify that the method and use of segmentation masks remains useful even in the regime of more labeled classification data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"The presentation overall is a bit confusing and difficult to follow, for me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"For example, Section 4.2 is titled “A Unified Architecture: GoCNN”, yet it is not an overview of the method as a whole, but a list of specific implementation details (even the very first sentence).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Minor: calling eq 3 a “regression loss” and writing “||0 - x||” rather than just “||x||” is not necessary and makes understanding more difficult,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,I’ve never seen a norm regularization term written this way or described as a “regression to 0”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Minor: in fig. 1 I think the FG and BG suppression labels are swapped: e.g., the “suppress foreground” mask has 1s in the FG and 0s in the BG (which would suppress the BG, not the FG).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,An additional question: why are the results in Table 4 with 100% privileged information different from those in Table 1-2?  Are these not the same setting?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"The ideas presented in this paper are novel and show some promise, but are currently not sufficiently ablated for readers to understand what aspects of the method are important.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Besides additional experiments, the paper could also use some reorganization and revision for clarity.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,particularly the full ImageNet evaluation results reported in Table 5 demonstrating that the background segmentation 'privileged information' is beneficial even with the full labeled ImageNet dataset,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,I've upgraded my rating from 4 to 6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"(I'll reiterate a very minor point about Figure 1 though: I still think the ""0"" and ""1"" labels in the top part of the figures should be swapped to match the other labels.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"e.g., the topmost path in figure 1a, with the text ""suppress foreground"", currently has 0 in the background and 1 in the foreground, when one would want the reverse of this to suppress the foreground.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,This paper proposes a modification to ConvNet training so that the feature activations before the linear classifier are divided into groups such that all pairs of features across all pairs of groups are encouraged to have low statistical correlation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Instead of discovering the groups automatically, the work proposes to use supervision, which they call privileged information, to assign features to groups in a hand-coded fashion.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The paper is clear and easy to follow,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The experimental results seem to show some benefit from the proposed approach,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"(1) The paper proposes one core idea (group orthogonality w/ privileged information), but then introduces background feature suppression without much motivation and without careful experimentation",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,(2) No comparison with an ensemble,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"(3) Full experiments on ImageNet under the ""partial privileged information"" setting would be more impactful",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,This paper is promising and I would be willing to accept an improved version.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"However, the current version lacks focus and clean experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"First, the abstract and intro focus on the need to replace ensembles with a single model that has diverse (ensemble like) features.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"The hope is that such a model will have the same boost in accuracy, while requiring fewer FLOPs and less memory.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Based on this introduction, I expect the rest of the paper to focus on this point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,But it does not; there are no experimental results on ensembles and no experimental evidence that the proposed approach in able to avoid the speed and memory cost of ensembles while also retaining the accuracy benefit.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Second, the technical contribution of the paper is presented as group orthogonality (GO).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"However, in Sec 4.1 the idea of background feature suppression is introduced.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"While some motivation for it is given, the motivation does not tie into GO.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,GO does not require bg suppression and the introduction of it seems ad hoc.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"Moreover, the experiments never decouple GO and bg suppression, so we are unable to understand how GO works on its own.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,This is a critical experimental flaw in my reading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Minor suggestions / comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The equation in definition 2 has an incorrect normalizing factor (1/c^(k)^2),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,Figure 1 seems to have incorrect mask placements.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The top mask is one that will mask out the background and only allow the fg to pass,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"The starting point of this work is the understanding that by having decorrelated neurons (e.g. neurons that only fire on background, or only on foreground regions) one provides independent pieces of information to the subsequent decisions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"As such one gives ""complementary viewpoints"" of the input to the subsequent layers, which can be thought of as performing ensembling/expert combination within the model, rather than using an ensemble of networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"For this, the authors propose a sensible method to decorrelate the activations of intermediate neurons, with the aim of delivering complementary inputs to the final classification layers: they split intermediate neurons to a ""foreground"" and a ""background"" subset, and append side-losses that force them to be zero on background and foreground pixels respectively.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"They demonstrate that this can improve classification on a mid-scale classification example (a fraction of imagenet, and a ResNet with 18, rather than 150 layers), when compared to a ""vanilla"" baseline that does not use these losses.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"I enjoyed reading the paper because the idea is simple, smart, and seems to be effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,But there are a few concerns;,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"firstly, the way of doing this seems very particular to vision.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"In vision one knows that masking the features (during both training and testing) helps, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1283",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"To be fair, this is not truly the same thing as what the authors are doing, because in the reference above the masking is computed  during both training and testing, while here it is used as a method of decorrelating neurons at training time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"But I understand that to the broader iclr community this may seem as ""yet another vision-specific trick"", while to the vision community one would ask why not just use the mask during both training and testing, since one can compute it in the first place.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"More importantly, the evaluation is quite limited; the authors use only one network (18 rather than 150 layers) and only part of imagenet for testing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,"They do get a substantial boost, but it is not clear if this will transfer to more data/layers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,The authors could at least have also tried CIFAR-10/100.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQPVFull,I would expect to see some more results during the rebuttal period.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1X3g2_xl,The authors propose to apply virtual adversarial training to semi-supervised classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1X3g2_xl,"It is quite hard to assess the novelty on the algorithmic side at this stage: there is a huge available literature on semi-supervised learning (especially SVM-related literature, but some work were applied to neural networks too); unfortunately the authors do not mention it, nor relate their approach to it, and stick to the adversarial world.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1X3g2_xl,"In terms of novelty on the adversarial side, the authors propose to add perturbations at the level of words embeddings, rather than the input itself (having in mind applications to NLP).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1X3g2_xl,"Concerning the experimental section, authors focus on text classification methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1X3g2_xl,"Again, comparison with the existing SVM-related literature is important to assess the viability of the proposed approach; for example (Wang et al, 2012) report 8.8% on IMBD with a very simple linear SVM (without transductive setup).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,I have two main concerns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,"One is the lack of comparisons to similar recently proposed methods - ""Learning Step Size Controllers for Robust Neural Network Training"" by Daniel et al. and ""Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent"" by Andrychowicz et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,The work of Daniel et al. is quite similar because it also proposes using a policy search RL method (REPS) and it is not clear what the downsides of their approach are.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,"Their work does use more prior knowledge as the authors stated, but why is this a bad thing?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,My second concern is with the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,Some of the numbers reported for the other methods are surprisingly low.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,"For example, why is RMSprop so bad in Table 2 and Table 3?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,"These results suggest that the methods are not being tuned properly, which reinforces the need for comparisons on standard architectures with previously reported results.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,And bayesian hyper-parameter optimization methods aim for multiple hyper-parameters but this work only tune one hyper-parameter.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy7m72Ogg,The network architecture used for the experiments on CIFAR-10 is quite outdated and the performances are much poorer than any work that has published in last few years.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ6idTdgg,The use of BN + Fast R-CNN only for pedestrian detection does not provide much signal about this choice.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ6idTdgg,There are also potential technical issues that are not discussed.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,What about an SVM using convnet features from the dataset at hand (light blue curve in figure 3),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,it should do at least as well as the light blue curve.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,There are also other works that could be considered which combine some of the advantages of kernel methods with deep networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Also the claim that the approach helps with the curse of dimensionality is sensible but not particularly explored.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,It also seems the curse of dimensionality could affect the scalability of creating a useful set of virtual instances.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,And it's unclear how CKM would work without any ORB features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Even if the method can (be adapted to) scale to n >> 10000, it's unclear whether it will be more useful than convnets in that domain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Indeed, in the experiments here, convnets essentially match CKMs in performance after 12,000 examples, and would probably perform better than CKMs on larger datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,We can only speculate because the experiments don't consider larger problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The methodology largely takes inspiration from sum product networks, but its application in the context of a kernel approach is reasonably original, and worthy of exploration.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"It's reasonable to expect the approach to be significant, but its significance is not demonstrated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The quality is high in the sense that the methods and insights are thoughtful, but suffers from broad claims and a lack of full and precise detail.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"In short: I like the paper, but it needs more specific details, and a full disclosure of where the method should be most applicable, and its precise advantages and limitations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Code would be helpful for reproducibility.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Thank you for an interesting read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The ideas presented have a good basis of being true, but the experiments are rather too simple.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,It would be interesting to see more empirical evidence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The approach seems to decrease the training time, which is of prime importance in deep learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Although, that comes at a price of slightly more complex model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,There is a grounded theory for sum-product functions which is basis for the compositional architecture described in the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Theoretically, any semiring and kernel could be used for the model which decreases need for handcrafting the structure of the model, which is a big problem in existing convolutional neural networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Cons,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,The experiments are on very simple dataset NORB.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Although, it is great to understand a model's dynamics on a simpler dataset, some analysis on complex datasets are important to act as empirical evidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The compositional kernel approach is compared to convolutional neural networks, hence it is only fair to compare said results on large datasets such as Imagenet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Minor,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Section 3.4 claims that CKMs model symmetries of objects.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,It felt that ample justification was not provided for this claim,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"This paper proposes a new learning framework called ""compositional kernel machines"" (CKM).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,It combines two ideas: kernel methods and sum-product network (SPN).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"CKM first defines leaf kernels on elements of the query and training examples, then it defines kernel recursively (similar to sum-product network).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,This paper has shown that the evaluation CKM can be done efficiently using the same tricks in SPN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,Positive: I think the idea in this paper is interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Instance-based learning methods (such as SVM with kernels) have been successful in the past, but have been replaced by deep learning methods (e.g. convnet) in the past few years.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,This paper investigate an unexplored area of how to combine the ideas from kernel methods and deep networks (SPN in this case).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Negative: Although the idea of this paper is interesting, this paper is clearly very preliminary.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"In its current form, I simply do not see any advantage of the proposed framework over convnet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,I will elaborate below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,1) One of the most important claims of this paper is that CKM is faster to learn than convnet.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,I am not clear why that is the case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Both CKM and convnet use gradient descent during learning, why would CKM be faster?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Also during inference, the running time of convnet only depends on its network structure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"But for CKM, in addition to the network structure, it also depends on the size of training set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"From this perspective, it does not seem CKM is very scalable when the training size is big.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,That is probably why this paper has to use all kinds of specialized data structures and tricks (even on a fairly simple dataset like NORB),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,2) I am having a hard time understanding what the leaf kernel is capturing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"For example, if the ""elements"" correspond to raw pixel intensities, a leaf kernel essentially compares the intensity value of a pixel in the query image with that in a training image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"But in this case, wouldn't you end up comparing a lot of background pixels across these two images (which does not help with recognition)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,I think it probably helps to explain Sec 3.1 a bit better.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"In its current form, this part is very dense and hard to understand.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,3) It is also not entirely clear to me how you would design the architecture of the sum-product function.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,The example is Sec 3.1 seems to be fairly arbitrary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,4),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,The experiment section is probably the weakest part.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,NORB is a very small and toy-ish dataset by today's standard.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Even on this small dataset, the proposed method is only slighly better than SVM (it is not clear whether ""SVM"" in Table 2 is linear SVM or kernel SVM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"If it is linear SVM, I suspect the performance of ""SVM"" will be even higher when you use kernel SVM), and far worse than convnet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"The proposed method only shows improvement over convnet on synthetic datasets (NORB compositions, NORM symmetries)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Overall, I think this paper has some interesting ideas.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"But in its current form, it is a bit too preliminary and more work is needed to show its advantage.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bm3T_lg,"Having said that, I acknowledge that in the machine learning history, many important ideas seem pre-mature when they were first proposed, and it took time for these ideas to develop.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,This paper introduces an additional reward-predicting head to an existing NN architecture for video frame prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"In Atari game playing scenarios, the authors show that this model can successfully predict both reward and next frames.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Paper is well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Model is clear to understand.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The model is incrementally different than the baseline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"The authors state that their purpose is to establish a pre-condition, which they achieve.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,But this makes the paper quite limited in scope.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"This paper reads like the start of a really good long paper, or a good short paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Following through on the future work proposed by the authors would make a great paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"As it stands, the paper is a bit thin on new contributions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The paper extends a recently proposed video frame prediction method with reward prediction in order to learn the unknown system dynamics and reward structure of an environment.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The method is tested on several Atari games and is able to predict the reward quite well within a range of about 50 steps.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"The paper is very well written, focussed and is quite clear about its contribution to the literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The experiments and methods are sound.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"However, the results are not really surprising given that the system state and the reward are linked deterministically in Atari games.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"In other words, we can always decode the reward from a network that successfully encodes future system states in its latent representation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The contribution of the paper is therefore minor.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The paper would be much stronger if the authors could include experiments on the two future work directions they suggest in the conclusions: augmenting training with artificial samples and adding Monte-Carlo tree search.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"The suggestions might decrease the number of real-world training samples and increase performance, both of which would be very interesting and impactful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"The topic of the paper, model-based RL with a learned model, is important and timely.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,The paper is well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,I feel that the presented results are too incremental.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,Augmenting the frame prediction network with another head that predicts the reward is a very sensible thing to do.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,"However neither the methodology not the results are novel / surprising, given that the original method of [Oh et al. 2015] already learns to successfully increment score counters in predicted frames in many games.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxhLAuxg,I’m very much looking forward to seeing the results of applying the learned joint model of frames and rewards to model-based RL as proposed by the authors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Description:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"This paper aims at compressing binary inputs and outputs of neural network models with unsupervised ""Bloom embeddings"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The embedding is based on Bloom filters: projecting an element of a set to different positions of a binary array by several independent hash functions, which allows membership checking with no missed but with possibly some false positives.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Inputs and outputs are assumed to be sparse.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The nonzero elements of an input are then simply encoded by Bloom filters onto the same binary array.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The neural network is run with the embedded inputs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Desired outputs are assumed to be a softmax-type ranking of different alternatives.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,a sort of back-projection step is needed to recover a probability ranking of the desired ground truth alternatives from the lower-dimensional output.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"For each ground-truth class, this is simply approximated as a product of the output values at the Bloom-filtered hash positions of that class.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The paper simply applies this idea, testing it on seven data sets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Scores and training times are compared to the baseline networks without embeddings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"Comparison embedding methods are mostly very traditional (hashing trick, error-correcting output codes, linear projection by canonical correlation analysis) but include one recent pairwise mutual information based approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,It is hard to see a lot of novelty in this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The Bloom filters are an existing technique, which is applied very straightforwardly here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The back-projection step of equation 2 is also a straightforward continuous-valued variant of the Bloom-filter membership test.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The way of recovering outputs is heuristic, since the neural network inbetween the embedded inputs and outputs is not really aware that the outputs will be run through a further back-projection step.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"In the comparisons of Table 3, only two embedding dimensionalities are used for each data set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"This is insufficient, since it leaves open the question whether other methods could get improved performance for higher/lower embeddings, relative to the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"(In appendix B, Figure 4, authors do compare their method to a variant of it for many different embedding dimensionalities; why not do this for all comparison methods too?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"Overall, this seems for the most part too close to off-the-shelf existing embedding to be acceptable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Minor points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"As the paper notes, dimensionality reduction of inputs by various techniques is common.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The paper lists some simple embeddings such as SVD based ones, CCA etc. but a more thorough review of other approaches including the vast array of nonlinear dimensionality reduction solutions should be mentioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The experiments in the paper seem to have an underlying assumption that inputs and outputs need to have the same type of embedding dimension.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,This seems unnecessary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The paper presents the idea of using Bloom filter encodings on the input features and the output layer of deep network to reduce the size of the network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Bloom-filter like encodings were proposed in Shi et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,(JMLR 2009),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"""Hash Kernels for Structured Data"" (see Theorem 2 and its proof), whereas it was proposed to encode the outputs in the context of multilabel classification in Cisse et al. (NIPS 2013)",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The paper still joins both ideas together, applies it to ranking problems, and presents extensive experiments in the context of deep neural networks and language modelling.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The main motivation of the paper is the reduction of model size for deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"There is a whole body of literature on this topic,  that is not mentioned at all in the paper, where the baselines are based on weight quantization (with an available implementation in TensorFlow https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/quantization).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"More recent methods are e.g.,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,1) the model compression approach of https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,2) training with integer/binary weights https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"Overall, the advantage of the Bloom filter approach is its simplicity and its wide applicability",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"it could, as well, be used in conjunction with weight quantization and other compression methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The main merits of the paper is to present extensive experiments on how well the vanilla Bloom filter approach can perform, but overall the novelty is fairly limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The authors propose a simple scheme based on Bloom filters to generate embeddings for inputs and outputs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"This reduces memory while introducing limited computational overhead, and it is simple enough to implement that it can easily be added to any practitioner's toolbox.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"Can be applied to practically any model, either at the input or hte output.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"Method is very straightforward: apply multiple hashes, instead of single one.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The algorithm for decoding is nice too.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,The paper is a bit difficult to read; the idea is really simple so it doesn't seem like it warrants such a complex description.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"The novelty of the approach is a bit limited since, as other reviewers have mentioned, Bloom filters are in use in a lot of areas including multi-label classification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,This seems like it would be a good short paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkKCdAdgx,"There's a lot of well fleshed out experiments, but the core of the paper is a bit incremental.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"Experimental results look reasonable, validated on 3 tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"References could be improved, for example I would rather see",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Rumelhart's paper cited for back-propagation than the Deep Learning book.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,The paper proposes a sparsely connected network and an efficient hardware architecture that can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully connected neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,The paper removes some of the connections in the fully connected layers and shows performance and computational efficiency increase in networks on three different datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,It is also a good addition that the authors combine their method with binary and ternary connect studies and show further improvements.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"The paper was hard for me to understand because of this misleading statement: In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks by reducing the number of connections of fully-connected networks using linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,It led me to think that LFSRs reduced the connections by keeping some of the information in the registers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"However, LFSR is only used as a random binary generator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Any random generator could be used but LFSR is chosen for the convenience in VLSI implementation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"This explanation would be clearer to me: In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks by randomly removing some of the connections in fully-connected networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"Random connection masks are generated by LFSR, which is also used in the VLSI implementation to disable the connections.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Algorithm 1 is basically training a network with back-propogation where each layer has a binary mask that disables some of the connections.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,This explanation can be added to the text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Using random connections is not a new idea in CNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,It was used between CNN layers in a 1998 paper by Yann LeCun and others: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf It was not used in fully connected layer before.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,The sparsity in fully connected layer decreases the computational burden but it is difficult to speed up.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Also the author's VLSI implementation does not speed up the network inference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,How are the results of this work compared to Network in Network (NiN)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"In NiN, the authors removed the fully connected layers completely and used a cheap pooling operation and also got improved performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Are the results presented here better?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"It would be more convincing to see this method tested on ImageNet, which actually uses a big fully connected layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Increased my rating from 5-6 after rebuttal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,From my original comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,The results looks good but the baselines proposed are quite bad.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"For instance in the table 2 ""Misclassification rate for a 784-1024-1024-1024-10 "" the result for the FC with floating point is 1.33%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"Well far from what we can obtain from this topology, near to 0.8%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"I would like to see ""significant"" compression levels on state of the art results or good baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"I can get 0,6% with two FC hidden layers...",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"In CIFAR-10 experiments, i do not understand  why ""Sparsely-Connected 90% + Single-Precision Floating-Point"" is worse than ""Sparsely-Connected 90% + BinaryConnect"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,So it is better to use binary than float.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Again i think that in the experiments the authors are not using all the techniques that can be easily applied to float but not to binary (gaussian noise or other regularizations).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Therefore under my point of view the comparison between float and binary is not fair.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,This is a critic also for the original papers about binary and ternary precision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,"In fact with this convolutional network, floating (standard) precision we can get lower that 9% of error rate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,Again bad baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,The authors reply still does not convince me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1fYuytex,I still think that the same technique should be applied on more challenging scenarios.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The paper develops a simple and reasonable algorithm for graph node prediction/classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The formulations are very intuitive and lead to a simple CNN based training and can easily leverage existing GPU speedups.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,Experiments are thorough and compare with many reasonable baselines on large and real benchmark datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"Although, I am not quite aware of the literature on other methods and there may be similar alternatives as link and node prediction is an old problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,I still think the approach is quite simple and reasonably supported by good evaluations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The paper introduces a method for semi-supervised learning in graphs that exploits the spectral structure of the graph in a convolutional NN implementation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The proposed algorithm has a limited complexity and it is shown to scale well on a large dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The comparison with baselines on different datasets show a clear jump of performance with the proposed method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"The paper is technically fine and clear, the algorithm seems to scale well, and the results on the different datasets compare very favorably with the different baselines.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The algorithm is simple and training seems easy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"Concerning the originality, the proposed algorithm is a simple adaptation of graph convolutional networks (ref Defferrard 2016 in the paper) to a semi-supervised transductive setting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"This is clearly mentioned in the paper, but the authors could better highlight the differences and novelty wrt this reference paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"Also, there is no comparison with the family of iterative classifiers, which usually compare favorably, both in performance and training time, with regularization based approaches, although they are mostly used in inductive settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,Below are some references for this family of methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,The authors mention that more complex filters could be learned by stacking layers but they limit their architecture to one hidden layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,They should comment on the interest of using more layers for graph classification.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"This model is used for semi-supervised learning on graphs, and in the experiments it demonstrated quite impressive results compared to other baselines, outperforming them by a significant margin.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,It is surprising that such a simple model works so much better than all the baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl,"Considering that the model used is just a two-layer model in most experiments, this is really surprising as a two-layer model is very local, and the output of a node can only be affected by nodes in a 2-hop neighborhood, and no longer range interactions can play any roles in this.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"This paper proposes to model relational (i.e., correlated) time series using a deep learning-inspired latent variable approach: they design a flexible parametric (but not generative) model with Gaussian latent factors and fit it using a rich training objective including terms for reconstruction (of observed time series) error, smoothness in the latent state space (via a KL divergence term encouraging neighbor states to be similarly distributed), and a final regularizer that encourages related time series to have similar latent state trajectories.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Relations between trajectories are hard coded based on pre-existing knowledge, i.e., latent state trajectories for neighboring (wind speed) base stations should be similar.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The model appears to be fit using gradient simple descent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"The authors propose several elaborations, including a nonlinear transition function (based on an MLP) and a reconstruction error term that takes variance into account.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"However, the model is restricted to using a linear decoder.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Experimental results are positive but not convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The authors target a worthwhile and challenging problem: incorporating the modeling of uncertainty over hidden states with the power of flexible neural net-like models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The idea of representing relationships between hidden states using KL divergence between their (distributions over) corresponding hidden states is clever.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Combined with the Gaussian distribution over hidden states, the resulting regularization term is simple and differentiable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,This general approach,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,focusing on writing down the problem as a neural network-like loss function,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"seems robust and flexible and could be combined with other approaches, including variants of variational autoencoders.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"The presentation is a muddled, especially the model definition in Sec. 3.3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The authors introduce four variants of their model with different combinations of decoder (with and without variance term) and linear vs. MLP transition function.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"It appears that the 2,2 variant is generally better but not on all metrics and often by small margins.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"This makes drawing a solid conclusions difficult: what each component of the loss contributes, whether and how the nonlinear transition function helps and how much, how in practice the model should be applied, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"I would suggest two improvements to the manuscript: (1) focus on the main 2,2 variant in Sec. 3.3 (with the hypothesis that it should perform best) and make the simpler variants additional ""baselines"" described in a paragraph in Sec. 4.1; (2) perform more thorough experiments with larger data sets to make a stronger case for the superiority of this approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The authors only allude to learning (with references to gradient descent and ADAM during model description) in this framework.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Inference gets its one subsection but only one sentence that ends in an ellipsis (?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,It's unclear what is the purpose of introducing the inequality in Eq. 9.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Experimental results are not convincing: given the size of the data, the differences vs. the RNN and KF baselines is probably not significant, and these aren't particularly strong baselines (especially if it is in fact an RNN and not an LSTM or GRU).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The position of this paper is unclear with respect to variational autoencoders and related models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Recurrent variants of VAEs (e.g., Krishnan, et al., 2015) seem to achieve most of the same goals as far as uncertainty modeling is concerned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,It seems like those could easily be extended to model relationships between time series using the simple regularization strategy used here.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Same goes for Johnson, et al., 2016 (mentioned in separate question).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,This is a valuable research direction with some intriguing ideas and interesting preliminary results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"I would suggest that the authors restructure this manuscript a bit, striving for clarity of model description similar to the papers cited above and providing greater detail about learning and inference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,They also need to perform more thorough experiments and present results that tell a clear story about the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,This manuscript proposes an approach for modeling correlated timeseries through a combination of loss functions which depend on neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"The loss functions correspond to: data fit term, autoregressive latent state term, and a term which captures relations between pairs of timeseries (relations have to be given as prior information).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Modeling relational timeseries is a well-researched problem, however little attention has been given to it in the neural network community.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Perhaps the reason for this is the importance of having uncertainty in the representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The authors correctly identify this need and consider an approach which considers distributions in the state space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The formulation is quite straightforward by combining loss functions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"The model adds to Ziat et al. 2016 in certain aspects which are well motivated, but unfortunately implemented in an unconvincing way.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"To start with, uncertainty is not treated in a very principled way, since the inference in the model is rather naive; I'd expect employing a VAE framework",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,[1] for better uncertainty handling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Furthermore, the Gaussian co-variance collapses into a variance, which is the opposite of what one would want for modelling correlated time-series.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"There are approaches which take these correlations into account in the states, e.g. [2].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"Moreover, the treatment of uncertainty only allows for linear decoding function f.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,This significantly reduces the power of the model.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,The paper could also easily be extended with more information about the model (what is the architecture of the MLP) as well as time complexity comparison between the models (especially between DFGs and this model).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,Minor remark:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ7O61Yxe,"The footnote 2 on page 5 seems to refer to the structural regularization term, not to the dynamical term.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,This paper aims to characterize the perceptual ability of a neural network under different input conditions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"This is done by manipulating the input image x in various ways (e.g. downsamplig, foveating), and training an auto-encoder to reconstruct the original full-resolution image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,MSE and qualitative results are shown and compared for the different input conditions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"Unfortunately, this paper seems to lack focus, presenting a set of preliminary inspections with few concrete conclusions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"For example, at the end of sec 4.4, ""This result is not surprising, given that FOV-R contains additional information ....",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"These results suggests that a small number of foveations containing rich details might be all these neural networks need...."".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,But this hypothesis is left dangling:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"What detailed regions are needed, and from where?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,For what sort of tasks?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"Secondly, it isn't clear to me what reconstruction behaviors are caused by a fundamental perception of the input, and what are artifacts of the autoencoder and pixelwise l2 loss?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"A prime example is texture, which the autoencoder fails to recover.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"But with a pixelwise loss, the network must predict high-frequency textures nearly pixel-for-pixel at training time; if this is impossible, then it will generate a pixelwise average of the training samples",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,a flat region.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"So then the network's inability to reconstruct textures is due to a problem generating them, specifically averaging from the training loss, not necessarily an issue in perceiving textures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"A network trained a different way (perhaps an adversarial network) may infer a texture is there, even if it wouldn't be able to generate it in a pixelwise l2 sense.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"Similarly, the ability to perform color reconstruction given a color glimpse I think has much to do with disambiguating the color of an object/scene:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"If there is an ambiguity, the network won't know which to ""choose"" (white flower or yellow flower?) and output an average, which is why there are so many sepia tones.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"However, in its section on this, the paper only measures the reconstruction error for different amounts of color given, and does not drill very far into any hypotheses for why this behavior occurs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"There are some interesting measurements here, such as the amount of color needed in the foveation to reconstruct a color image, and the discussion on global features, which may start to get at a mechanism by which glimpses may propagate to an entire reconstruction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,But overall it's hard to know what to take away from this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"What are larger concrete conclusions that can be garnered from the details, and what mechanisms bring them about?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Can these be more thoroughly explored with more focus?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,I like the idea the paper is exploring.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Nevertheless I see some issues with the analysis:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"To get a better understanding of the quality of the results, I think at least some state-of-the-art comparisons should be included (e.g. by setting d times",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,d pixel patches too their average and applying a denoising autoencoder).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"If they perform significantly better, then this indicates that the presented model is not yet taking all the information from the input image that could be used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,SCT-R and FOV-R are supposed to test how much information can be restored from the Fovea alone as opposed to the Fovea together with low resolution periphery.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"However, there is an additional difference between the two conditions: According to the paper, in SCT-R, part of the image was set to zero, while in FOV-R it was removed alltogether.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"With only one or two hidden layers, I could easily imagine this making a difference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"On page 4, you compare the performance of FOV-R (1% error) with that of DS-D (1.5%) and attribute this to information about the periphery that the autoencoder extracts from the fovea.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"While this might be the case, at least part of the reduced error will be due to the fact that the fovea is (hopefully) perfectly reconstructed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"To answer the actual question ""how much additional information about the periphery can be extracted from the fovea"", you should consider calculating the error only in the periphery, i.e. the part of the image where DS-D and FOV-R got exactly the same input for.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Then any decreased error is only due to the additional fovea information.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Other issues:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"The images in Figure 2 (a) and (b) in the rows ""factor 2"", ""factor 4"", ""factor 8"" look very blurry.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,There seems some interpolation to be going on (although slighly different than the bilinear interpolation).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,This makes it hard to asses how much information is in these images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"I think it would be much more insightfull to print them with ""nearest"" interpolation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Figure 3 caption too vague.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Maybe add something like footnote 2?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,Often figures appear too early in paper which leads to lots of distance between text and figures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"This paper is motivated by the ability that human's visual system can recognize contents of environment by from critical features, and tried to investigate whether neural networks can also have this kind of ability.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"However, there are several concerns:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"1. The baselines of the paper are too weak. Nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic and cubic interpolations without any learning procedure are of course performed worse than AE based models. The author should compare with the STOA methods such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk36NgFeg,"2. Can the experiments based on AE support the idea that artificial neural networks can perceive an image from low fidelity? AE is only a kind of neural network, can the conclusion extend to other kind of networks? I think it would be much better if the authors can provide a more general conclusion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,The paper presents an analysis of the ability of deep networks with ReLU functions to represent particular types of low-dimensional manifolds.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,"While the presented results are novel to the best of my knowledge, they are hardly surprising (1) given what we already know about the representational power of deep networks and (2) given that the study selects a deep network architecture and a data structure that are very ""compatible"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,"In particular, I have three main concerns with respect to the results presented in this paper:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,"(1) In the last decade, there has been quite a bit of work on learning data representations from sets of local tangent planes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,"Examples that spring to mind are local tangent space analysis of Zhang & Zha (2002), manifold charting by Brand (2002) and alignment of local models by Verbeek, Roweis, and Vlassis (2003).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ3filKll,"None of this work is referred to in related work, even though it seems highly relevant to the analysis presented here.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,It develops a simple toy programming language that includes loops and branching.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,The aim is to determine whether all variables in the program are defined before they are used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,The paper tries a variety of off-the-shelf sequence classification models and develops a new model that makes use of a ``differentiable set'' to keep track of which variables have been defined so far.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,One further question is if the authors could clarify what reasoning patterns are needed to solve these problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,"Does the model need to, e.g., statically determine whether an `if` condition can ever evaluate to true in order to solve these tasks?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,"Learning a static analyzer is an interesting concept, and I think there is good potential for this line of work",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,The experimental setup seems reasonable,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,The differentiable set seems like a useful (albeit simple) modelling tool,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,Weaknesses:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,"The one novelty on the modelling front (the differentiable set) provides a small win on this task, but it's not clear if it is a useful general construct or not.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,They do it with a toy programming language and a very simplified analysis problem,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry54RWtxx,"While the idea is interesting and might be developped into a tool in the future, the toy task presented in this paper is too simple to warrant an ICLR submission.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Jhfftgx,Many things don't quite make sense to me:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Jhfftgx,"1. Most seq2seq models (such as those used for parsing) have substantially better performance when coupled with beam search than greedy search, and exact search is infeasible. This is because these models are trained to condition on discrete values of past outputs in each timestamp, and hence the problem of finding the highest-scoring total sequence of outputs is not solvable efficiently. It's unclear what kind of model this paper is using which allows for greedy decoding, and how well it compares to the state-of-the-art, specially when constraint-aware beam search is used. This comparison is specially interesting because both constrained beam search and this dual-decomposition-like approach require multiple computations of the model's score.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Jhfftgx,2. It's unclear (to me at least) how to differentiate the constraint term g() in the objective function in the general case (though the particular example used here is understandable),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Jhfftgx,"3. The paper claims that ""Lagrangian relaxation methods for NLP have multipliers for each output variable that can be combined with linear models [...] .

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"In the authors' previous works, they showed the superiority of deep networks over shallows when the activation function is ReLu and the pooling is max/mean pooling but in the current paper there is no activation function after conv and the pooling is just a multiplication of the node values.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,This paper studies the convolutional arithmetic circuits and shows how this model can address the inductive biases and how pooling can adjust these biases.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,This interesting contribution gives an intuition about how deep network can capture the correlation between the input variables when its size is polynomial but and correlation is exponential.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"It worth to note that although the authors tried to express their notation and definitions carefully where they were very successful, it would be helpful if they elaborate a bit more on their definitions, expressions, and conclusions in the sense to make them more accessible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,The paper provides a highly complex algebraic machinery to analyze the type of functions covered by convolutional network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"As in most attempts  in this direction in the literature, the ideal networks described in paper, which have to be interpretable as polynomials over tensors, do not match the type of CNNs used in practice: for instance the Relu non-linearity is replaced with a product of linear functions (or a sum of logs).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"While the paper is very technical to read, every concept is clearly stated and mathematical terminology properly introduced.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Still, I think some the authors could make some effort to make the key concepts more accessible, and give a more intuitive understanding of what the separation rank means rather before piling up different mathematical interpretation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"My SVM-era algebra is quite rusted, and I am not familiar with the separation rank framework: it would have been much easier for me to first fully understand a simple and gentle case (shallow network in section 5.3), than the general deep case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,To summarize my understanding of the key theorem 1 result:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"The upper bound of the separation rank is used to show that in the shallow case, this rank grows AT MOST linearly with the network size (as measured by the only hidden layer).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"So exponential network sizes are caused by this rank needing to grow exponentially, as required by the partition.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"In the deep case, one also uses the case that the upper bound is linear in the size of the network (as measured by the last hidden layer), however, this situation is caused by the selection of a partition (I^low, J^high), and the maximal rank induced by this partition is only linear anyway, hence the network size can remain linear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"If tried my best to summarize the key point of this paper and still probably failed at it, which shows how complex is this notion of partition rank, and that its linear growth with network size can either be a good or bad thing depending on the setting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Hopefully, someone will come one day with an explanation that holds in a single slide.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"While this is worth publishing as conference paper in its present form, I have two suggestions that, IMHO, would make this work more significant:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"On the theory side, we are still very far from the completeness of the PAC bound papers of the ""shallow era"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"In particular, the non-probabilistic lower and upper bound in theorem 1 are probably loose, and there is no PAC-like theory to tell us which one to use and what is the predicted impact on performance (not just the intuition).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Also, in the prediction of the inductive bias, the other half is missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"This paper attempts to predict the maximal representation capacity of a DNN under bounded network size constraints, but one of the reason why this size has to be bounded is overfitting (justified by PAC or VC-dim like bounds).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"If we consider the expected risk as  the sum of the empirical risk and the structural risk, this paper only seems to address fully the empirical risk minimization part, freezing the structural risk.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"On the practice side, an issue is that experiments in this paper mostly confirm what is obvious through intuition, or some simpler form of reasonings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,For instance to use convolutions that join pixels which are symmetrical in images to detect symmetry.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Basic hand-crafted pattern detectors, as they have been used in computer vision for decades, would just do the job.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"What would be a great motivation for using this framework is if it answered questions that simple human intuition cannot, and for which we are still in the dark: one example I could think of in the recent use of gated convolutions 'a trous' for 1D speech signal, popularized in Google WaveNet (https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,Note that 1D inputs would also simplify the notation!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"This paper addresses the question of which functions are well suited to deep networks, as opposed to shallow networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,The basic intuition is convincing and fairly straightforward.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,Pooling operations bring together information.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"When information is correlated, it can be more efficiently used if the geometry of pooling regions matches the correlations so that it can be brought together more efficiently.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,Shallow networks without layers of localized pooling lack this mechanism to combine correlated information efficiently.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"The theoretical results are focused on convolutional arithmetic circuits, building on prior theoretical results of the authors.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"The results make use of the interesting technical notion of separability, which in some sense measures the degree to which a function can be represented as the composition of independent functions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Because separability is measured relative to a partition of the input, it is an appropriate mechanism for measuring the complexity of functions relative to a particular geometry of pooling operations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Many of the technical notions are pretty intuitive, although the tensor analysis is pretty terse and not easy to follow without knowledge of the authors’ prior work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"In some sense the comparison between deep and shallow networks is somewhat misleading, since the shallow networks lack a hierarchical pooling structure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"For example, a shallow convolutional network with RELU and max pooling does not really make sense, since the max occurs over the whole image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,So it seems that the paper is really more of an analysis of the effect of pooling vs. not having pooling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"For example, it is not clear that a deep CNN without pooling would be any more efficient than a shallow network, from this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"It is not clear how much the theoretical results depend on the use of a model with product pooling, and how they might be extended to the more common max pooling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"Even if theoretical results are difficult to derive in this case, simple illustrative examples might be helpful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"In fact, if the authors prepare a longer version of the paper for a journal I think the results could be made more intuitive if they could add a simple toy example of a function that can be efficiently represented with a convolutional arithmetic circuit when the pooling structure fits the correlations, and perhaps showing also how this could be represented with a convolutional network with RELU and max pooling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,I would also appreciate a more explicit discussion of how the depth of a deep network affects the separability of functions that can be represented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVsEMYel,"A shallow network doesn’t have local pooling, so the difference between deep and shallow if perhaps mostly one of pooling vs. not pooling.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,The number of fixation points is controlled to be fixed for each frame - how is this done?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,In practice we freeze the layers of the C3D network to values pretrained by Tran etal.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,`we added them trained central bias',0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,This paper proposes a new method for estimating visual attention in videos.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"The input clip is first processed by a convnet (in particular, C3D) to extract visual features.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,The visual features are then passed to LSTM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,The hidden state at each time step in LSTM is used to generate the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"Finally, the visual attention map is generated from the Gaussian mixture model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"Overall, the idea in this paper is reasonable and the paper is well written.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"RNN/LSTM has been used in lots of vision problem where the outputs are discrete sequences, there has not been much work on using RNN/LSTM for problems where the output is continuous like in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"In particular, it outperforms other state-of-the-art on the saliency prediction task on the Hollywood2 datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,It also shows improvement over baselines (e.g. C3D + SVM) on the action recognition task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"My only ""gripe"" of this paper is that this paper is missing some important baseline comparisons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"In particular, it does not seem to show how the ""recurrent"" part help the overall performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"Although Table 2 shows RMDN outperforms other state-of-the-art, it might be due to the fact that it uses strong C3D features (while other methods in Table 2 use traditional handcrafted features).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,Since saliency prediction is essentially a dense image labeling problem (similar to semantic segmentation).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"For dense image labeling, there has been lots of methods proposed in the past two years, e.g. fully convolution neural network (FCN) or deconvnet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,A straightforward baseline is to simply take FCN and apply it on each frame.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJRpRfKxx,"If the proposed method still outperforms this baseline, we can know that the ""recurrent"" part really helps.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"This is a well written, organized, and presented paper that I enjoyed reading.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,I commend the authors on their attention to the narrative and the explanations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"While it did not present any new methodology or architecture, it instead addressed an important application of predicting the medications a patient is using, given the record of billing codes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The dataset they use is impressive and useful and, frankly, more interesting than the typical toy datasets in machine learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"That said, the investigation of those results was not as deep as I thought it should have been in an empirical/applications paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Despite their focus on the application, I was encouraged to see the authors use cutting edge choices (eg Keras, adadelta, etc) in their architecture.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,A few points of criticism:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,The numerical results are in my view too brief.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Fig 4 is anecdotal, Fig 5 is essentially a negative result (tSNE is only in some places interpretable), so that leaves Table 1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"I recognize there is only one dataset, but this does not offer a vast amount of empirical evidence and analysis that one might expect out of a paper with no major algorithmic/theoretical advances.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,To be clear I don't think this is disqualifying or deeply concerning; I simply found it a bit underwhelming.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"To be constructive, re the results I would recommend removing Fig 5 and replacing that with some more meaningful analysis of performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"I found Fig 5 to be mostly uninformative, other than as a negative result, which I think can be stated in a sentence rather than in a large figure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,There is a bit of jargon used and expertise required that may not be familiar to the typical ICLR reader.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,I saw that another reviewer suggested perhaps ICLR is not the right venue for this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"While I certainly see the reviewer's point that a medical or healthcare venue may be more suitable, I do want to cast my vote of keeping this paper here... our community benefits from more thoughtful and in depth applications.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Instead I think this can be addressed by tightening up those points of jargon and making the results more easy to evaluate by an ICLR reader (that is, as it stands now researchers without medical experience have to take your results after Table 1 on faith, rather than getting to apply their well-trained quantitative eye).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Overall, a nice paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"In light of the detailed author responses and further updates to the manuscript, I am raising my score to an 8 and reiterating my support for this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,I think it will be among the strongest non-traditional applied deep learning work at ICLR and will receive a great deal of interest and attention from attendees.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,This paper describes modern deep learning approach to the problem of predicting the medications taken by a patient during a period of time based solely upon the sequence of ICD-9 codes assigned to the patient during that same time period.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"This problem is formulated as a multilabel sequence classification (in contrast to language modeling, which is multiclass classification).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"They propose to use standard LSTM and GRU architectures with embedding layers to handle the sparse categorical inputs, similar to that described in related work by Choi, et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"In experiments using a cohort of ~610K patient records, they find that RNN models outperform strong baselines including an MLP and a random forest, as well as a common sense baseline.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The differences in performance between the recurrent models and the MLP appear to be large enough to be significant, given the size of the test set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Very important problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"As the authors point out, two the value propositions of EHRs",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,which have been widely adopted throughout the US due to a combination of legislation and billions of dollars in incentives from the federal government,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,included more accurate records and fewer medication mistakes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,These two benefits have largely failed to materialize.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,This seems like a major opportunity for data mining and machine learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Paper is well-written with lucid introduction and motivation, thorough discussion of related work, clear description of experiments and metrics, and interesting qualitative analysis of results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Empirical results are solid with a strong win for RNNs over convincing baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"This is in contrast to some recent related papers, including Lipton & Kale et al, ICLR 2016, where the gap between the RNN and MLP was relatively small, and Choi et al, MLHC 2016, which omitted many obvious baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Discussion is thorough and thoughtful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,The authors are right about the kidney code embedding results: this is a very promising result.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The authors make several unintuitive decisions related to data preprocessing and experimental design, foremost among them the choice NOT to use full patient sequences but instead only truncated patient sequences that each ends at randomly chosen time point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"This does not necessarily invalidate their results, but it is somewhat unnatural and the explanation is difficult to follow, reducing the paper's potential impact.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,It is also reduces the RNN's potential advantage.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The chosen metrics seem appropriate, but non-experts may have trouble interpreting the absolute and relative performances (beyond the superficial, e.g., RNN score 0.01 more than NN!).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,The authors should invest some space in explaining (1) what level of performance,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,for each metric,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"would be necessary for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting and (2) whether the gaps between the various models are ""significant"" (even in an informal sense).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The paper proposes nothing novel in terms of methods, which is a serious weakness for a methods conference like ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"I think it is strong enough empirically (and sufficiently interesting in application) to warrant acceptance regardless, but there may be things the authors can do to make it more competitive.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"For example, one potential hypothesis is that higher capacity models are more prone to overfitting noisy targets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Is there some way to investigate this, perhaps by looking at the kinds of errors each model makes?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"I have a final comment: as a piece of clinical work, the paper has a huge weakness: the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,Models are both trained and tested on data with noisy labels.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"For training, the authors are right that this shouldn't be a huge problem, provided the label noise is random (even class conditional isn't too big of a problem).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"For testing, though, this seems like it could skew metrics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"Further, the assumption that the label noise is not systemic seems very unlikely given that these data are recorded by human clinicians.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The cases shown in Appendix C lend some credence to this assertion: for Case 1, 7/26 actual medications received probabilities < 0.5.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,My hunch is that clinical reviewers would view the paper with great skepticism.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,The authors will need to get creative about evaluation,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,or invest a lot of time/money in labeling data,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,to really prove that this works.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"For what it is worth, I hope that this paper is accepted as I think it will be of great interest to the ICLR community.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"However, I am borderline about whether I'd be willing to fight for its acceptance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,If the authors can address the reviewers' critiques,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"and in particular, dive into the question of overfitting the imperfect labels and provide some insights",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,I might be willing to raise my score and lobby for acceptance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,This is a well-conducted and well-written study on the prediction of medication from diagnostic codes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,"The authors compared GRUs, LSTMs, feed-forward networks and random forests (making a case for why random forests should be used, instead of SVMs) and analysed the predictions and embeddings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,The authors also did address the questions of the reviewers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEgeXFex,My only negative point is that this work might be more relevant for a data science or medical venue rather than at ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,This paper presents a method for embedding data instances into a low-dimensional space that preserves some form of similarity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"Although the paper presents this notion as new, basically every pre-trained embedding (be it auto-encoders or word2vec) has been doing the same: representing items in a low-dimensional space that inherently encodes their similarities.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"Even when looking at the specific case of word/context embeddings, the method is not novel either: this method is almost identical to one of the similarity functions presented in ""A Simple Word Embedding Model for Lexical Substitution"" (Melamud et al., 2015).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,The novelty claim must be more accurate and position itself with respect to existing work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"In addition, I think the evaluation could be done better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"There are plenty of benchmarks for word embeddings in context, for example:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"* http://veceval.com/ (Nayak et al., RepEval 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,* Lexical Substitution in Context,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,And many higher-level tasks where word similarity in context could be a game-changer:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,* Semantic Text Similarity,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,* Recognizing Textual Entailment / Natural Language Inference,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,I was disappointed that none of these were even brought up.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,this paper proposes to use feed-forward neural networks to learn similarity preserving embeddings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,They also use the proposed idea to represent out-of-vocabulary words using the words in given context.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"First, considering the related work [1,2] the proposed approach brings marginal novelty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,Especially,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,Context Encoders is just a small improvement over word2vec.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,Experimental setup should provide more convincing results other than visualizations and non-standard benchmark for NER evaluation with word vectors [3].,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,This paper introduces a similarity encoder based on a standard feed-forward neural network with the aim of generating similarity-preserving embeddings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,The approach is utilized to generate a simple extension of the CBOW word2vec model that transforms the learned embeddings by their average context vectors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,Experiments are performed on an analogy task and named entity recognition.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"While this paper offers some reasonable intuitive arguments for why a feed-forward neural network can generate good similarity-preserving embeddings, the architecture and approach is far from novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"As far as I can tell, the model is nothing more than the most vanilla neural network trained with SGD on similarity signals.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,Slightly more original is the idea to use context embeddings to augment the expressive capacity of learned word representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"Of course, using explicit contextual information is not a new idea, especially for tasks like word sense disambiguation (see, e.g., 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should also be cited), but the specific method used here is original, as far as I know.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,The evaluation of the method is far from convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,The corpora used to train the embeddings are far smaller than would ever be used in practice for unsupervised or semi-supervised embedding learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"The performance on the analogy task says little about the benefit of this method for larger corpora, and, as the authors mentioned in the comments, they expect ""the gain will be less significant, as the global context statistics brought in by the ConEc can also be picked up by word2vec with more training.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"The argument can be made (and the authors do claim) that extrinsic evaluations are more important for real-world applications, so it is good to see experiments on NER.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"However, again the embeddings were trained on a very small corpus and I am not convinced that the observed benefit will persist when trained on larger corpora.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,"Overall, I believe this paper offers little novelty and weak experimental evidence supporting its claims.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkBsEQYll,I cannot recommend it for acceptance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,I think the write-up can be improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,The results of the paper also might be somewhat misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,The behavior for when weights are 0 is not revealing of how the model works in general.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,I think the work also underestimates the effect of the nonlinearities on the learning dynamics of the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"This paper studies the optimization issue of linear ResNet, and shows mathematically that for 2-shortcuts and zero initialization, the Hessian has condition number independent of depth.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,I skimmed through the proof but have not checked them carefully.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,This result is a nice observation for training deep linear networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,But I do not think the paper has fully resolved the linear vs nonlinear issue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,Some question:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"1. Though the revision has added some results using ReLU units, it seems it is only added to the mid positions of the network (sec 5.3), is this how it is typically done in ResNet? Moreover, ReLU is not differentiable at zero point, which does not satisfy the condition you had in Theorem 1. Why not use differentiable activations like sigmoid or tanh?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"2. From equation (22) in the appendix, it seems for nonlinear activations, the condition number depends on the derivative \sigma^\prime at 0. Therefore, if we use tanh which has derivative 1 at zero, the condition number is the same for linear and tanh activations. But this probably is not enough to explain the bit difference in performance or optimization for linear and nonlinear networks, or how the situations evolve after learning the 0 point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"3. As for the success of ResNet (or convnets in general) in computer vision, I believe there are more types of nonlinearity such as pooling? Can the result here generalizes to pooling as well?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,Minor:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"sec 1 last paragraph, low approximation error typically means more powerful model class and better training error, but not necessarily better test error",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"sec 4.1 what do you mean by ""zero initialization with small random perturbations""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"why not exactly zero initialization, how large is the random perturbation?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"ResNet and other architectures that use shortcuts have shown empirical success in several domains and therefore, studying the optimization for such architectures is very valuable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,This paper is an attempt to address some of the properties of networks that use shortcuts.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,Some of the experiments in the paper are interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"However, there are two main issues with the current paper:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,1- linear vs non-linear: I think studying linear networks is valuable but we should be careful not to extend the results to networks with non-linear activations without enough evidence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"This is especially true for Hessian as the Hessian of non-linear networks have very large condition number (see the ICLR submission ""Singularity of Hessian in Deep Learning"") even in cases where the optimization is not challenging.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"Therefore, I don't agree with the claims in the paper on non-linear networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,"Moreover, one plot on MNIST is not enough to claim that non-linear networks behave similar to linear networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,2- Hessian at zero initial point: The explanation of why we should be interested in Hessain at zero initial point is not acceptable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJAr0QFxe,The zero initial point is not interesting because it is a very particular point that cannot tell us about the Hessian during optimization.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"This paper presents an improved neural language models designed for selected long-term dependency, i.e., to predict more accurately the next identifier for the dynamic programming language such as Python.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,The improvements are obtained by:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"1) replacing the fixed-widow attention with a pointer network, in which the memory only consists of context representation of the previous K identifies introduced for the entire history.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"2) a conventional neural LSTM-based language model is combined with such a sparse pointer network with a controller, which linearly combines the prediction of both components using a dynamic weights, decided by the input, hidden state, and the context representations at the time stamp.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"Such a model avoids the the need of large window size of the attention to predict next identifier, which usually requires a long-term dependency in the programming language.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,This is partly validated by the python codebase (which is another contribution of this paper) experiments in the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"While the paper still misses some critical information that I would like to see, including how the sparse pointer network performance chances with different size of K, and how computationally efficient it is for both training and inference time compared to LSTM w/ attention of various window size, and ablation experiments about how much (1) and (2) contribute respectively, it might be of interest to the ICLR community to see it accepted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,This paper uses a pointer network over a sparse window of identifiers to improve code suggestion for dynamically-typed languages.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,Code suggestion seems an area where attention and/or pointers truly show an advantage in capturing long term dependencies.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"The sparse pointer method does seem to provide better results than attention for similar window sizes - specifically, comparing a window size of 20 for the attention and sparse pointer method shows the sparse pointer winning fairly definitively across the board.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"Given a major advantage of the pointer method is being able to use a large window size well thanks to the supervision the pointer provides, it was unfortunate (though understandable due to potential memory issues) not to see larger window sizes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,Having a different batch size for the sparse pointer and attention models is unfortunate given it complicates an otherwise straight comparison between the two models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,The construction and filtering of the Python corpus sounds promising but as of now it is still inaccessible (listed in the paper as TODO).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"Given that code suggestion seems an interesting area for future long term dependency work, it may be promising as an avenue for future task exploration.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,Overall this paper and the dataset are likely an interesting contribution even though there are a few potential issues.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"This paper takes a standard auto-regressive model of source code and augments it with a fixed attention policy that tracks the use of certain token types, like identifiers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,Additionally they release a Python open source dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"As expected this augmentation, the fixed attention policy, improves the perplexity of the model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,It seems important to dig a bit deeper into these results and show the contribution of different token types to the achieve perplexity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"This is alluded to in the text, but a more thorough comparison would be welcome.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"The idea of an attention policy that takes advantage of expert knowledge is a nice contribution, but perhaps if limited novelty",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1kQkVFgl,"for example the Maddison and Tarlow 2014 paper, which the authors cite, has scoping rules that track previously used identifiers in scope.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The abstract and introduction point out that AlphaGo requires many RL iterations to train, and propose to improve this by swapping out the policy network with one that is more amenable to training.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"However, the paper only presents supervised learning results, not RL.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"While it’s not unreasonable to assume that a higher-capacity network that shows improvements in supervised learning will also yield dividends in RL, it’s still unsatisfying to be presented with SL improvements and be asked to assume that the RL improvements will be of a similar magnitude, whatever that may mean.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"It would’ve been more convincing to train both AlphaGo and this paper's architectures on an equal number of RL self-play iterations, then have them play each other.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"(Both would be pre-trained using supervised training, as per the AlphaGo paper).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,It is not until section 3.3 that it is clearly stated this is strictly a supervised-learning paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,This should have been put front and center in the abstract and introduction.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Fully 3 pages are spent on giant but simple architecture diagrams.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,This is both extravagant and muddles the exposition.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"It seems better to show just the architectures used in the experiments, and spend at most half a page doing so, so that they may be seen alongside one another.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The results (Table 1, Figures 7 and 8) are hard to skim, as there is little information in the captions, and the graph axes are poorly labeled.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"For example, I assume “Examples” in figures 7 and 8 should be “Training examples”, and the number of training examples isn’t 0-50, but some large multiple thereof.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Results:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The take-home seems to be that that deeper networks do better, and residual architectures and spatial batch normalization each improve the results in this domain, as they are known to do in others.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"Furthermore, we are asked to assume that the improvements in an RL setting will be similar to the improvements in SL shown here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,These results seem too incremental to justify an ICLR publication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,This paper reports new CNN architectures for playing Go.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The results are better than previously reported, but there is no mention of computational time and efficiency, and relative metric of performance/flop or performance/flop/energy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Overall a good paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The paper trains slightly different network architectures on Computer Go, and provides an analysis of the accuracy as the number of training samples increases and the network architecture differs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The paper looks like a follow up paper of the author’s previous paper Cazenave (2016a), however, the contribution over the previous paper is not clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,A section should be added to state what the differences are.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"The paper states that the improvements that are obtained in this study are because of the changes in the training set, the input features and the architecture of the network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,It is not clear what are the changes that were done to the training set and input features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,How are they different than the previous work?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,The paper investigates several different architectures for move prediction in computer Go.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,The main innovation seems to be the use of residual networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,The best proposed architecture outperforms previous results on KGS move prediction dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,The network also reached amateur 3 dan level on KGS.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,I found the paper to be somewhat poorly written and lacking important details.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Here are my main concerns:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,1) This paper references a previous paper by the author(Cazenave 2016a) as having introduced residual network architectures to computer go.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,The overlap with this paper seems quite significant but I could not find it anywhere.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,What exactly is new?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"2) The author claims the addition of batch norm to a residual architecture as the main architectural innovation, but the original ResNet paper was already using batch norm between the convolution and activation layers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Have you compared your architecture (ResNet with batch norm after ReLU) with the original ResNet architecture (batch norm before ReLU)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,3) It is not at all surprising that ResNets do slightly better than vanilla CNNs on move prediction.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,I don't think this alone is enough for an ICLR paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,"It would be good to see at least a comparison of several different variants of the network evaluated at actually playing Go, even if it's against other bots like GnuGo, Pachi, and Fuego.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,4) Are the differences between net_dark and your proposed networks after 20 iterations (Table 1) significant?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk67W4Yxl,Please also see my original questions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,I would definitely love to have this and use it for my research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,A great tool.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"However, the paper lacks detail.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"In particular, I feel that it is impossible for someone to reimplement the research-mostly because of the lack of detail.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"However, replicability is a crucial part of science.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Other publications proposing software (e.g. the tensorflow, theano and edward papers) come along with open source code.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,This is not the case here and therefore the picture is quite incomplete.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,I am not convinced that ICLR is the right venue: robotics conferences such as IROS and ICRA might appreciate it much more.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Nevertheless, this is just an encouragement to the authors to interact with those communities.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,A differentiable physics engine is indeed a wonderful thing to have.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"The key selling point of the proposed software is its speed, however there is no comparison to other physics engines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Besides describing the engine's speed in rather creative units (e.g. ""model seconds per day""), the reader has no idea if this is fast or slow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,Todorov's engine (my simulator of choice) computes a dynamics step and its derivatives wrt both states and controls (using finite-differences) in less than 1ms for a *full humanoid* model (his code is available here mujoco.org/book/programming.html#saDerivative).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"I think this actually faster than the engine described in this paper, but I can't be sure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Because this engine is so limited in what it can collide (sphere/sphere and sphere/plane), it would be trivial to build the example models in several other popular engines (e.g. ODE, Bullet and MuJoCo) and simply compare the performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,Until this comparison is done I consider the paper to be incomplete.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"This paper creates a physics simulator using theano, and uses it to learn a neural network policy by back propagating gradients through the simulation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"The approach is novel, and is motivated by being able to learn policies for robotics.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,My two key reservations with the paper are as follows:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"1. The method is motivated by learning policies for robotics. However, the proposed method is *only* useful for robotics if the learned policy can transfer the real world. Transferring policies from simulation to real-world is an open research problem, and is particularly challenging with less realistic simulators.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"2. They key novelty/benefit of this approach over other model-based approaches is that the simulator is differentiable. However, the only empirical comparison in the paper is to a model-free approach (CMA-ES). To appropriately demonstrate the approach, it should be compared to other model-based approaches, which do not require analytic derivatives of the model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"For the reader to fully understand the pros and cons of the approach, the paper should also include quantitative comparison between the speed of the proposed simulator, and that of standard simulation platforms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Because the idea is interesting and novel, I think it lies above the acceptance threshold.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"However, it would be significantly improved with the aforementioned comparisons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"Lastly, the writing of the paper could be improved, as it is rather informal and/or imprecise in a number of places.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,Here are some examples:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"“we model the use of a neural network as a general controller for a robot” - can be more concisely phrased as something like “we model the robot controller using a neural network” or “the robot controller is modeled using a neural network""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"“In previous research, finding a gradient…” - This is a run-on sentence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,“We basically jam this entire equation into” - This sentence is informal and imprecise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,“deep learning neural network” - the word “learning” should be omitted,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,"“one big RNN, where we unfold over time” - should be “…RNN, which we unfold over time” or “…RNN, unfolded over time”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyEiHNKxx,The writing would also be improved by making it more concise and fitting the paper into 8 pages.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This paper has two main contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"(1) Applying adversarial training to imagenet, a larger dataset than previously considered",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"(2) Comparing different adversarial training approaches, focusing importantly on the transferability of different methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,The authors also uncover and explain the label leaking effect which is an important contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"This paper is clear, well written and does a good job of assessing and comparing adversarial training methods and understanding their relation to one another.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,A wide range of empirical results are shown which helps elucidate the adversarial training procedure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This paper makes an important contribution towards understand adversarial training and believe ICLR is an appropriate venue for this work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This paper investigate the phenomenon of the adversarial examples and the adversarial training on the dataset of ImageNet.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"While the final conclusions are still vague, this paper raises several noteworthy finding from its experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,The paper is well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Although I still have some concerns about the paper (see the comments below), this paper has good contributions and worth to publish.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"For the first time in the literature, this paper proposed the concept of ‘label leaking’.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Although its effect only becomes significant when the dataset is large, it should be carefully handled in the future research works along this line.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Using the ratio of 'clean accuracy' over ‘adversarial accuracy’ as the measure of robust is more reasonable compared to the existing works in the literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Although the conclusions of the paper are based on the experiments on ImageNet, the title of the paper seems a little misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,I consider Section 4 as the main contribution of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Note that Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 are not specific to large-scale dataset, thus emphasizing the ‘large-scale’ in the title and in the introduction seems improper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Basically all the conclusions of the paper are made based on observing the experimental results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Further tests should have been performed to verify these hypotheses.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Without that, the conclusions of the paper seems rushy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"For example, one dataset of imageNet can not infer the conclusions for all large-scale datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This paper is a well written paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This paper can be divided into 2 parts:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,1.Adversary training on ImageNet,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"2.Empirical study of label leak, single/multiple step attack, transferability and importance of model capacity",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"For part [1], I don’t think training without clean example will not make reasonable ImageNet level model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Ian’s experiment in “Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples” didn't use BatchNorm, which may be important for training large scale model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,This part looks like an extension to Ian’s work with Inception-V3 model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,I suggest to add an experiment of training without clean samples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"For part [2], The experiments cover most variables in adversary training, yet lack technical depth.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"The depth, model capacity experiments can be explained by regularizer effect of adv training;  Label leaking is novel; In transferability experiment with FGSM, if we do careful observe on some special MNIST FGSM example, we can find augmentation effect on numbers, which makes grey part on image to make the number look more like the other numbers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"Although this effect is hard to be observed with complex data such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, they may be related to the authors' observation ""FGSM examples are most transferable"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,"In this part the authors raise many interesting problems or guess, but lack theoretical explanations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx,Overall I think these empirical observations are useful for future work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,This submission proposes an approach to adapting the variational auto-encoder framework (VAE) to the clustering scenario.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,First the model has to be adapted (with a Gaussian mixture as a prior) and then the inference has to become consistent (by introducing a regularization term).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,A general positive point about this paper is that the model construction is kept simple.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Indeed, the assumption about the mixture prior is simple but reasonable, and the inference follows the VAE framework where appropriate with only changing parts that do not conform with the clustering task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,These changes are also motivated by some analysis.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"The presentation is also kept simple: the linking to VAE and related methods is made in an clear and honest way, so that it's easy to follow the paper and understand how everything fits together.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Also, the regularization term is a well motivated and reasonable addition.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Given the VAE context in this paper, I'd be interested in seeing a discussion on the variance of the samples in (6).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"A negative issue of this paper is that all crucial regularizations rely upon ad-hoc parameters that control their strength, namely \eta (eq. (3)) and \alpha (eq. 7).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"According to the authors adjusting these parameters is crucial, and there seems to be no principled way of adjusting them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"It also seems that these two parameters interact, since they both regularize z in different ways.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"This makes the search space over them grow multiplicatively, since the tuning problem now becomes combinatorial.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"The authors mention that they tune the trade-off between these two regularizers, but I'd be interested in a comment concerning how this is done (what's the space of parameters to search on).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"In practical clustering applications, high sensitivity to tuned parameters is undesirable, since one also needs to cross-validate values of K at the same time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,I really liked the experiments section.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"It is not very exhaustive in terms of comparison, but it is very exploratory in terms of demonstrating the model components, strengths and weaknesses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,This is much more useful than reporting unintuitive percentage improvements relative to arbitrarily selected baselines and datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Overall, I am a little concerned about the practicality of this approach, given the tuning it requires.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"However, I am in favor of accepting this paper because it makes its strong and weak points very clear through good explanation and demonstration.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Therefore, I expect further research to be built on top of this paper, so that the aforementioned issues will hopefully be alleviated in the future.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Finally, the theoretical intuitions given in the paper (and author comments) improve its usefulness as a scientific manuscript.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,The authors posit a mixture of Gaussian prior for variational,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,auto-encoders.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,They also consider a regularization term motivated,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,from information theory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,The modeling extension is simple and the inference follows,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,mechanically from what's already standard in the literature.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,in the ELBO (expected log-likelihood) will overpower the regularizer;,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,is this not the case in a mean-field approximation to a mixture of,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,The experiments are limited on toy data and only a few mixture,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,components are considered (not enough where the collapsed approach,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,The use of a mixture of VAE is an incremental idea if novel.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,I would like to see the comparison with the more straightforward use of a mixture of gaussians prior.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,This model is more complex and I would like to see a justification of this additional complexity.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,Was the best run maximizing the validation performance or the test performance ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx7Jrtgl,"Moreover, the average performance (higher) and standard deviation (lower) of Adversarial Autoencoder makes me question the claim that ""we have advanced the state of the art in deep unsupervised clustering both in theory and practice"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"(Indeed, I am sure the authors have a much more experiential and detailed understanding of the limitations of their work than I do).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,What I see presented is a nice system that has been demonstrated to handle spatiotemporal trajectories.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,The claims made should correspond to this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,I would consider adjusting my rating to a 7 depending on future revisions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,The paper presents a method for joint motion prediction and activity classification from sequences with two different applications: motion of fruit flies and online handwriting recognition.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"The method uses a classical encoder-decoder pipeline, with skip connections allowing direct communication between the encoder and the decoder on respective levels of abstraction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,Motion is discretized and predicted using classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,The model is trained on classification loss combined with a loss on motion prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,The goal is to leverage latter loss in a semi-supervised setting from parts of the data which do not contain action labels.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,The idea of leveraging predictions to train feature representations for discrimination is not new.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"However, the paper presents a couple of interesting ideas, partially inspired from other work in other areas.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,My biggest concern is with the experimental evaluation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"The experimental section contains a large amount of figures, which visualize what the model has learned in a qualitative way.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"However, quantitative evaluation is rarer.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"Again on the fly application, the performance gain on motion prediction in figure 5c looks small compared to the baseline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,I am not sure it is significant.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,I did not see any recognition results on the handwriting application.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,Has this part not been evaluated?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,Figure 5a is difficult to understand and to interpret.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"The term ""BesNet"" is used here without any introduction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,Figure 4 seems to tell multiple and different stories.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,I'd suggest splitting it into at least two different figures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,This paper proposes a recurrent architecture for simultaneously predicting motion and action states of agents.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"The paper is well written, clear in its presentation and backed up by good experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"They demonstrate that by forcing the network to predict motion has beneficial consequences on the classification of actions states,",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,allowing more accurate classification with less training data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,They also show how the information learned by the network is interpretable and organised in a hierarchy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,a critical discussion on the interplay between motion an behaviour that is needed to experience the benefits of their proposed model is missing from the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"moreover, a discussion on how this approach could scale to more challenging scenarios ""involving animals"" and visual input for instance and more general ""behaviours"" is also missing;",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"The criticism here is pointed at the fact that the title/abstract claim general behaviour modelling, whilst the experiments are focused on two very specific and relatively simple scenarios,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,making the original claim a little bit far fetched unless its backed up by additional evidence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkLhzHtlg,"Using ""Insects"", or ""fruit flies"" would be more appropriate than ""animals"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,First I would like to apologize for the delay in reviewing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,Summary : this work introduces a novel memory based artificial neural network for reading comprehension. Experiments show improvement on state of the art.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,The originality of the approach seems to be on the implementation of an iterative procedure with a loop testing that the current answer is the correct one.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,In order to get a better sense of the reason for improvement it would be interesting to have a complexity and/or a time analysis of the algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,I might be mistaken,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,but I don't see you reporting anything on the actual number of loops necessary in the reported experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"The dataset description in section 2.2, should be moved to section 4 where the other datasets are described.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,Thie paper proposed an iterative memory updating model for cloze-style question-answering task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"The approach is interesting, and result is good.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"For the paper, I have some comments:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"1. Actually the model in the paper is not single model, it proposed two models. One consists of ""reading"", ""writing"", ""adaptive computation"" and "" Answer module 2"", the other one is ""reading"", ""composing"", ""writing"", ""gate querying"" and ""Answer module 1"". Based on the method section and the experiment, it seems the ""adaptive computation"" model is simpler and performs better. And without two time memory update in single iteration and composing module, the model is similar to neural turing machine.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,2. What is the MLP setting in the composing module?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"3. This paper tested different size of hidden state:[256, 368, 436, 512], I do not find any relation between those numbers, how could you find 436? Is there any tricks helping you find those numbers?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"4. It needs more ablation study about using different T such as T=1,2..",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"5. According to my understanding, for the adaptive computation,  it would stop when the P_T <0. So what is the distribution of T in the testing data?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,This paper proposed an iterative query updating mechanism for cloze-style QA.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"The approach is novel and interesting and while it is only verified in the paper for two Cloze-style tasks (CBT and WDW), the concept of read/compose/write operations seem to be more general and can be potentially applied to other reasoning tasks beyond Cloze-style QA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"Another advantage of the proposed model is to learn when to terminate the iteration by the so-called adaptive computation model, such that it avoids the issue of treating the number of iterations as another hyper-parameter, which is a common practice of iterative models/multi-hop reasoning in previous papers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,There are a couple places that this paper can improve.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"First, I would like to see the results from CNN/Daily Mail as well to have a more comprehensive comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8TGSKlg,"Secondly, it will be useful to visualize the entire M^q sequence over time t (not just z or the query gating) to help understand better the query regression and if it is human interpretable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"This paper presents a heuristic for avoiding large negative rewards which have already been experienced by distilling such events into a ""danger model"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,The paper is well written including some rather poetic language,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,The heuristic is evaluated in two toy domains.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,This paper addresses an important and timely topic in a creative way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,I consider it to have three flaws (and one good idea).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"1) insufficient context of what is known and had been studied before (in shallow RL), for example within the field of “robust RL”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,A good place to start might be with the work of Shie Mannor.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,2) an ill-defined general problem setup.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,Does it make sense to do post-hoc labeling of certain actions as “catastrophic” if the agent is not informed about that metric during learning?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"Training a system to do one thing (maximize reward), but then evaluating it with a different metric is misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"On the training metric, it could even be that the baseline outperforms the new algorithm?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,So I’d want to see plots for “average reward” in fig 3 as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"Also, what would the baseline learn if it was given large negative rewards for entering these otherwise invisible “danger states”?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"3) a somewhat ad-hoc solution, that introduces new domain-specific hyperparameters (k_r, k_lambda and lambda) a second deep network and and two additional replay memories.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"In terms of results, I’m also unsure whether I can trust the results, given the long-standing track-record of cart-pole being fully solved by many methods: is DQN an outlier here?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,Or is the convnet not an appropriate function-approximator?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,Actually: which exact variant “state-of-the-art” variant of DQN are you using?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"The good idea that I encourage the authors to pursue further is D_d, this set of rare but dangerous states, that should be kept around in some form.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,I see it as an ingredient for continual learning that most typical methods lack,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"it is also one of the big differences between RL and supervised learning, where such states would generally be discarded as outliers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"Given my comment a couple of weeks ago, and the prompt response (“we implemented expected SARSA”), I would have expected that the paper had been revised with the new results by now?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tHvHKge,"Minor comment: the bibliography is done sloppily, with missing years, conference venues and missing/misspelled author lists, e.g. “Sergey et al. Levine”. I also think it is good form to cite the actual conference publications instead of arXiv where applicable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,I'm torn on this one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"Seeing the MPEG-7 dataset and references to curvature scale space brought to mind the old saying that ""if it's not worth doing, it's not worth doing well.""",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"If we give them the benefit of the doubt that this was worth doing, then the approach they pursue using a Siamese configuration makes sense, and their adaptation of deep convnet frameworks to 1D signals is reasonable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"To the extent that the old invariant based methods made use of smoothed/filtered representations coupled with nonlinearities, it's sensible to revisit this problem using convnets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"I wouldn't mind seeing this paper accepted, since it's different from the mainstream, but I worry about there being too narrow an audience at ICLR that still cares about this type of shape representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,Authors show that a contrastive loss for a Siamese architecture can be used for learning representations for planar curves.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"With the proposed framework, authors are able to learn a representation which is comparable to traditional differential or integral invariants, as evaluated on few toy examples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,The paper is generally well written and shows an interesting application of the Siamese architecture.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"However, the experimental evaluation and the results show that these are rather preliminary results as not many of the choices are validated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"My biggest concern is in the choice of the negative samples, as the network basically learns only to distinguish between shapes at different scales, instead of recognizing different shapes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"It is well known fact that in order to achieve a good performance with the contrastive loss, one has to be careful about the hard negative sampling, as using too easy negatives may lead to inferior results.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"Unfortunately, this is not discussed in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BymIbLKgl,"Furthermore the paper misses a more thorough quantitative evaluation and concentrates more on showing particular examples, instead of measuring more robust statistics over multiple curves (invariance to noise and sampling artifacts).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJpfMIFll,So I don't think we can use F-measure to compare.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJpfMIFll,The V-measure seems to be tilted towards systems that have high number of senses per word.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,The authors have grouped recent work in convolutional neural network design (specifically with respect to image classification) to identify core design principles guiding the field at large.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,The 14 principles they produce (along with associated references) include a number of useful and correct observations that would be an asset to anyone unfamiliar with the field.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,Overall the writing seems to jump around a bit and the motivations behind some design principles feel lost in the confusion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"For example, ""Design Pattern 4: Increase Symmetry argues for architectural symmetry as a sign of beauty and quality"" is presented as one of 14 core design principles without any further justification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"Similarly ""Design Pattern 6: Over-train includes any training method where the network is trained on a harder problem than necessary to improve generalization performance of inference"" is presented in the middle of a paragraph with no supporting references or further explanation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,The experimental portion of this paper feels scattered with many different approaches being presented based on subsets of the design principles.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"It is a useful and perhaps noble task to collect and distill research from many sources to find patterns (and perhaps gaps) in the state of a field; however, some of the patterns presented do not seem well developed and include principles that are poorly explained.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,The authors take on the task of figuring out a set of design patterns for current deep architectures - namely themes that are recurring in the literature.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"Similarly some of the patterns are as vague as ""Increase symmetry"" and are backed up by statements such as ""we noted a special degree of elegance in the FractalNet"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,I do not see how this leads to a design pattern that can be applied to a new architecture - or if it applies to anything other than the FractalNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"Some other patterns are phrased with weird names ""7 Cover the problem space"" - which I guess stands for dataset augmentation; or ""6 over-train"" which is not backed up by a single reference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"Unless the authors relate it to regularization (text preceding ""overtrain""), which then has no connection to the description of ""over-train"" provided by the authors (""training a network on a harder problem to improve generalization"").",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJQNqLFgl,"If ""harder problem"" means one where one adds an additional term (i.e. the regularizer), the authors are doing harm to the unexperienced reader, confusing ""regularization"" with something that sounds like ""overfitting"" (i.e. the exact opposite).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"They find that there is a significant performance gap between the two approaches, in favour of deep CNNs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"The experiments are well designed and involve a distillation training approach, and the results are presented in a comprehensive manner.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,They also observe (as others have before) that student models can be shallower than the teacher model from which they are trained for comparable performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"My take on these results is that they suggest that using (deep) conv nets is more effective, since this model class encodes a form of a-prori or domain knowledge that images exhibit a certain degree of translation invariance in the way they should be processed for high-level recognition tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"The results are therefore perhaps not quite surprising, but not completely obvious either.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"An interesting point on which the authors comment only very briefly is that among the non-convolutional architectures the ones using 2 or 3 hidden layers outperform those with 1, 4 or 5 hidden layers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,Do you have an interpretation / hypothesis of why this is the case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,It  would be interesting to discuss the point a bit more in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,It was not quite clear to me why were the experiments were limited to use  30M parameters at most.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,None of the experiments in Figure 1 seem to be saturated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"Although the performance gap between CNN and MLP is large, I think it would be worthwhile to push the experiment further for the final version of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,The authors state in the last paragraph that they expect shallow nets to be relatively worse in an ImageNet classification experiment.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,Could the authors argue why they think this to be the case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,One could argue that the much larger training dataset size could compensate for shallow and/or non-convolutional choices of the architecture.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"Since MLPs are universal function approximators, one could understand architecture choices as expressions of certain priors over the function space, and in a large-data regimes such priors could be expected to be of lesser importance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,This issue could for example be examined on ImageNet when varying the amount of training data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r10FA8Kxg,"Also, the much higher resolution of ImageNet images might have a non-trivial impact on the CNN-MLP comparison as compared to the results established on the CIFAR10 dataset.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Model contains an undirected discrete component that captures distribution over disconnected manifolds and a directed hierarchical continuous component that models the actual manifolds (induced by the discrete variables).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,In essence the model clusters the data and at the same time learns a continuous manifold representation for the clusters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The training procedure for such models is also presented and is quite involved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"Experiments illustrate state-of-the-art performance on public datasets (including MNIST, Omniglot, Caltech-101).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Overall the model is interesting and could be useful in a variety of applications and domains.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The approach is complex and somewhat mathematically involved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"It's not exactly clear how the model compares or relates to other RBM formulations, particularly those that contain discrete latent variables and continuous outputs.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"In Proc. of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 1025–1032, 2009.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Discussion of this should certainly be added.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,This paper presents a way of training deep generative models with discrete hidden variables using the reparameterization trick.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"It then applies it to a particular DBN-like architecture, and shows that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art density modeling performance on MNIST and similar datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"The paper is well written, and the exposition is both thorough and precise.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,There are several appendices which justify various design decisions in detail.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,I wish more papers in our field would take this degree of care with the exposition!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"The log-likelihood results are quite strong, especially given that most of the competitive algorithms are based on continuous latent variables.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Probably the main thing missing from the experiments is some way to separate out the contributions of the architecture and the inference algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"(E.g., what if a comparable architecture is trained with VIMCO, or if the algorithm is applied to a previously published discrete architecture?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,I’m a bit concerned about the variance of the gradients in the general formulation of the algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,See my comment “variance of the derivatives of F^{-1}” below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"I think the response is convincing, but the problem (as well as “engineering principles” for the smoothing distribution) are probably worth pointing out in the paper itself, since the problem seems likely to occur unless the user is aware of it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"(E.g., my proposal of widely separated normals would be a natural distribution to consider until one actually works through the gradients — something not commonly done in the age of autodiff frameworks.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Another concern is how many sequential operations are needed for inference in the RBM model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"(Note: is this actually an RBM, or a general Boltzmann machine?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The q distribution takes the form of an autoregressive model where the variables are processed one at a time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"Section 3 mentions the possibility of grouping together variables in the q distribution, and this is elaborated in detail in Appendix A.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,But the solution requires decomposing the joint into a product of conditionals and applying the CDFs sequentially.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"So either way, it seems like we’re stuck handling all the variables sequentially, which might get expensive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Minor: the second paragraph of Section 3 needs a reference to Appendix A.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,This is an interesting paper on how to handle reparameterization in VAEs when you have discrete variables.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The idea is to introduce a smoothing transformation that is shared between the generative model and the recognition model (leading to cancellations).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,A second contribution is to introduce an RBM as the prior model P(z) and to use autoregressive connections in generative and recognition models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The whole package becomes a bit entangled and complex and it is hard to figure out what causes the claimed good performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,Experiments that study these contributions separately would have been nice.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,The framework does become a little complex but this should not be a problem if nice software is delivered that can be used in a plug and play mode.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,"Overall, the paper is very rich with ideas",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryMxXPFex,so I think it would be a great contribution to the conference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"The system described works comparably to bi-directional LSTM baseline for NMT, and CNN's are naturally parallelizable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"Key ideas include the use of two stacked CNN's (one for each of encoding and decoding) for translation, with res connections and position embeddings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"The use of CNN's for translation has been attempted previously (as described by the authors), but presumably it is the authors' combination of various architectural choices (attention, position embeddings, etc) that make the present system competitive with RNN's, whereas earlier attempts were not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,They describe system's sensitivity to some of these choices (e.g. experiments to choose appropriate number of layers in each of the CNN's).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,The experimental results are well reported in detail.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,One or two figures would definitely be required to help clarify the architecture.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,This paper is less about new ways of learning representations than about the combination of choices made (over the set of existing techniques) in order to get the good results that they do on the reported NMT tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"In this respect, while I am fairly confident that the paper represents good work in machine learning, I am not quite as confident about its fit for this particular conference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,This paper is the first (I believe) to establish a simple yet important result that Convnets for NMT encoders can be competitive to RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,The authors present a convincing set of results over many translation tasks and compare with very competitive baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,I also appreciate the detailed report on training and generation speed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"I find it's very interesting when position embeddings turn out to be hugely important (beside residual connections); unfortunately, there is little analysis to shed more lights on this aspect and perhaps compare other ways of capturing positions (a wild guess might be to use embeddings that represent some form of relative positions).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,The only concern I have (similar to the other reviewer) is that this paper perhaps fits better in an NLP conference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,One minor comment: it's slight strange that this well-executed paper doesn't have a single figure on the proposed architecture :),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"It will also be even better to draw a figure for the biLSTM architecture as well (it does take some effort to understand the last paragraph in Section 2, especially the part on having a linear layer to compute z).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,The paper reports a very clear and easy to understand result that a convolutional network can be used instead of the recurrent encoder for neural machine translation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"Apart from the known architectural elements, such as convolution, pooling, residual connections, position embeddings, the paper features one unexpected architectural twist: two stacks of convolutions, one for computing alignment and another for computing the representations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"The empirical evidence that this was necessary is provided, however the question of *why* it is necessary remains open.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,The experimental evaluation is very extensive and leaves no doubt that the proposed approach works well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"The convnet-based model was faster at evaluation, but it is not very clear what is the main speed-up factor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,It’s however hard to argue against the fact that the speed advantage of convnets is likely to increase if a more parallel implementation is considered.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAA4wKxg,"My main concern is whether or not the paper is appropriate for ICLR, because the contribution is quite incremental and rather application-specific.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xUYDYgg,"1. In Tab. 4 different batch sizes are used.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xUYDYgg,"2. In Fig. 6, why not include more information in the graphs? Especially, as stated in the question, why not include the node.js values?

Even if not, these are good values to compare with. For the sake of consistency, please include in both subfigures Firefox, Chrome, node.js.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,Visualizations comparing integrated gradients with standard gradients on real images input to the Inception CNN show that integrated gradients correspond to an intuitive notion of feature importance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"While motivation and qualitative examples are appealing, the paper lacks both qualitative and quantitative comparison to prior work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,Only the baseline (simply the standard gradient) is presented as reference for qualitative comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Yet, the paper cites numerous other works (DeepLift, layer-wise relevance propagation, guided backpropagation) that all attack the same problem of feature importance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,Lack of comparison to any of these methods is a major weakness of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,I do not believe it is fit for publication without such comparisons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,My pre-review question articulated this same concern and has not been answered.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"The authors propose to measure “feature importance”, or specifically, which pixels contribute most to a network’s classification of an image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,A simple (albeit not particularly effective) heuristic for measuring feature importance is to measure the gradients of the predicted class wrt each pixel in an input image I.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,This assigns a score to each pixel in I (that ranks how much the output prediction would change if a given pixel were to change).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"In this paper, the authors build on this and propose to measure feature importance by computing gradients of the output wrt scaled version of the input image, alpha*I, where alpha is a scalar between 0 and 1, then summing across all values of alpha to obtain their feature importance score.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Here the scaling is simply linear scaling of the pixel values (alpha=0 is all black image, alpha=1 is original image).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"The authors call these scaled images “counterfactuals” which seems like quite an unnecessarily grandiose name for literally, a scaled image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,The authors show a number of visualizations that indicate that the proposed feature importance score is more reasonable than just looking at gradients only with respect to the original image.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"They also show some quantitative evidence that the pixels highlighted by the proposed measure are more likely to fall on the objects rather than spurious parts of the image (in particular, see figure 5).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,The method is also applied to other types of networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,The quantitative evidence is quite limited and most of the paper is spent on qualitative results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"While the goal of understanding deep networks is of key importance, it is not clear whether this paper really help elucidate much.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,The main interesting observation in this paper is that scaling an image by a small alpha (i.e. creating a faint image) places more “importance” on pixels on the object related to the correct class prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Beyond that, the paper builds a bit on this, but no deeper insight is gained.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"The authors propose some hand-wavy explanation of why using small alpha (faint image) may force the network to focus on the object, but the argument is not convincing.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Ultimately, it is not clear how the proposed scheme for feature importance ranking is useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"First, it is still quite noisy and does not truly help understand what a deep net is doing on a particular image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,Performing a single gradient descent step on an image (or on the collection of scaled versions of the image) hardly begins to probe the internal workings of a network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Moreover, as the authors admit, the scheme makes the assumption that each pixel is independent, which is clearly false.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"Considering the paper presents a very simple idea, it is far too long.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,"The main paper is 14 pages, up to 19 with references and appendix.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,In general the writing is long-winded and overly verbose.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJzaDdYxx,The authors do not explain why visualizing regular gradients isn't correlated with the importance of features relevant to the given visual category and proceed to the interior gradient approach.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,I think this would help relate it to the prior work more clearly as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"This paper studies the problem of abstract hierarchical multiagent RL with policy sketches, high level descriptions of abstract actions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"The work is related to much previous work in hierarchical RL, and adds some new elements by using neural implementations of prior work on hierarchical learning and skill representations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"Sketches are sequences of high level symbolic labels drawn from some fixed vocabulary, which initially are devoid of any meaning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,Eventually the sketches get mapped into real policies and enable policy transfer and temporal abstraction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,Learning occurs through a variant of the standard actor critic architecture.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"Experiments are provided through a standard game like domain (maze, minecraft etc.).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,The paper as written suffers from two problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"One, the idea of policy sketches is nice, but not sufficiently fleshed out to have any real impact.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,It would have been useful to see this spelled out in the context of abstract SMDP models to see what they bring to the table.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,What one gets here is some specialized invocation of this idea in the context of the specific approach proposed here.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"Second, the experiments are not thorough enough in terms of comparing with all the related work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"For example, Ghavamzadeh et al. explored the use of MAXQ like abstractions in the context of mulitagent RL.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"It would be great to get a more detailed comparison to MAXQ based multiagent RL approaches, where the value function is explicitly decomposed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,The paper proposes a new RL architecture that aims at learning policies from sketches,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,i.e sequence of high-level operations to execute for solving a particular task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,The model relies on a hierarchical structure where the sub-policy is chosen depending on the current operation to execute in the sketch .,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"The learning algorithm is based on an extension of the actor-critic model for that particular case, and also involves curriculum learning techniques when the task to solve is hard.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,Experimental results are provided on different learning problems and compared to baseline methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,The paper is well-written and very easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,I am not really convinced by the impact of such a paper since the problem solved here can be seen as an option-learning problem with a richer supervision (i.e the sequence of option is given).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,It thus corresponds to an easier problem with a limited impact.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"Moreover, I do not really understand to which concrete application this setting corresponds.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"For example, learning from natural langage instructions is clearly more relevant.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"So since the model proposed in this article is not a major contribution and shares many common ideas with existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods,  the paper lacks a strong motivation and/or concrete application.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"So, the paper only has a marginal interest for the RL community",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,@pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,* Original problem with well design experiments,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,* Simple adaptation of the actor-critic method to the problem of learning sub policies,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,@cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,"* Very simple task that can be seen as a simplification of more complex problems like options discovery, hierarchical RL or learning from instructions",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1kjdOYlx,* No strong underlying applications that could help to 'reinforce' the interest of the approach,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"I was holding off on this review hoping to get the missing details from the code at https://github.com/alexnowakvilla/DP, but at this time it's still missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,After going over this paper couple of times I'm still missing the details necessary to reproduce the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"I think this would be a common problem for readers of this paper, so the paper needs to be improved, perhaps with a toy example going through all the stages of learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"As an example of the difficulty, take section 4.3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"It talks about training ""split block"" which is a function that can assign each element to either partition 0 or partition 1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"At this point I'm looking at it as a binary classification problem and looking for the parameters, loss, and how this loss is minimized.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"Instead I get a lot of unexpected information, such as ""we must create artificial targets at every node of the generated tree from the available final target partition"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"What are these artificial targets, and how do they relate to the problem of training the splitter?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,An example that explicitly goes through this construction would help with understanding.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,The basic idea of this contribution is very nice and worth pursuing: how to use the powerful “divide and conquer” algorithm design strategy to learn better programs for tasks such as sorting or planar convex hull.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"However, the execution of this idea is not convincing and needs polishing before acceptance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"As it is right now, the paper has a proof-of-concept feel that makes it great for a workshop contribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,My main concern is that the method presented is currently not easily applicable to other tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"Typically, demonstrations of program induction from input-output examples on well known tasks serves the purpose of proving, that a generic learning machine is able to solve some well known tasks, and will be useful on other tasks due to its generality.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"This contribution, however, presents a learning machine that is very hand-tailored to the two chosen tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The paper essentially demonstrates that with enough engineering (hardcoding the recurrency structure, designing problem-specific rules of supervision at lower recurrency levels) one can get a partially trainable sorter or convex hull solver.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,I found the contribution relatively hard to understand.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"High level ideas are mixed with low-level tricks required to get the model to work and it is not clear either how the models operate, nor how much of them was actually learned, and how much was designed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The answer to the questions did hep, nut didn't make it into the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,Mixing the descriptions of the tricks required to solve the two tasks makes things even more confusing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,I believe that the paper would be much more accessible if instead of promising a general solution it clearly stated the challenges faced by the authors and the possible solutions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,Highlights:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,+ Proof-of-concept of a partially-trainable implementation of the important “divide and conquer” paradigm,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,++ Explicit reasoning about complexity of induced programs,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,The solution isn’t generic enough to be applicable to unknown problems - the networks require tricks specific to each problem,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The writing style pictures the method as very general, but falls back on very low level details specific to each task",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,I find this paper extremely hard to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The main promise of the paper is to train models for combinatorial search procedures, especially for dynamic programming to learn where to split and merge.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,The present methodology is supposed to make use of some form of scale invariance property which is scarcely motivated for most problems this approach should be relevant for.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"However, the general research direction is fruitful and important.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The paper would be much more readable if it would start with a clear, formal problem formulation, followed by some schematic view on the overall flow and description on which parts are supervised, which parts are not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,Also a tabular form and sample of the various kinds problems solved by this method could be listed in the beginning as a motivation with some clear description on how they fit the central paradigm and motivate the rest of the paper in a more concrete manner.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"Instead, the paper is quite chaotic, switching between low-level and high level details, problem formulations and their solutions in a somewhat random, hard to parse order.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,Both split and merge phases seem to make a lot of discrete choices in a hierarchical manner during training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"The paper does not explain how those discrete choices are backpropagated through the network in an unbiased manner, if that is the case at all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"In general, the direction this paper is exciting, but the paper itself is a frustrating read in its present form.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,I have spent several hours on it without having to manage to achieve a clear mental image on how all the presented pieces fit together.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy3_KuYxg,"I would revise my score if the paper would be improved greatly from a readability perspective, but I think it would require a major rewrite.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"On one hand, this was very helpful for me to better understand the current paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"On the other hand, this was very needed for me to better understand the current paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"Overall, while I think that I like this work, and while I am familiar with the JSB chorales, with probabilistic approaches, with n-grams, etc, I did find the paper quite hard to follow at various parts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,The extensive use of notation did not help the clarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"I think the ideas and approaches are good, and certainly worth publishing and worth pursuing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"I am not sure that, in the paper's current form, ICLR is an appropriate venue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"(Incidentally, the issue is not the application as I think that music applications can be very appropriate, nor is the problem necessarily with the approach... see my next suggestion..).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"I get the sense that a long-form journal publication would actually give the authors the space necessary to fully explain these ideas, provide clearer running examples where needed, provide the necessary background for the appropriate readership, provide the necessary background on the previous system, perhaps demonstrating results on a second dataset to show generality of the approach, etc.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,A short conference paper just seems to me to be too dense a format for giving this project the description it merits.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"[Addendum: based on discussions here & revisions, I have revised my score]",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The paper presents an advanced self-learning model that extracts compositional rules from Bach's chorales, which extends their previous work in: 1) the rule hierarchy in both conceptual and informational dimensions; 2) adaptive 2-D memory selection which assumes the features follow Dirichlet Distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"Sonority (column of 4 MIDI numbers) acts as word in language model: unigram statistics have been used to learn the fundamental rules in music theory, while n-grams with higher order help characterize part writing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,Sonorities have been clustered together based on feature functions through iterations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,The partition induced by the features is recognized as a rule if it is sufficiently significant.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"As a result, two sample syllabi with different difficulty strides and ""satisfactory gaps"" have been generated in terms of sets of learned rules.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,1. Quality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"a) Strengths: In the paper, the exploration of hierarchies in two dimensions makes the learning process more cognitive and interpretable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,The authors also demonstrate an effective memory selection to speed up the learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"b) Flaws: The paper only discussed N<=5, which might limit the learning and interpretation capacities of the proposed model, failing to capture long-distance dependence of music.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"(In the replies to questions, the authors mentioned they had experimented with max N=10, but I'm not sure why related results were not included in the paper).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"Besides the elaborated interpretation of results, a survey seeking the opinions of students in a music department might make the evaluation of system performance more persuasive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,2. Clarity:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,a) Pros: The paper clearly delivers an improved automatic theorist system which learns and represents music concepts as well as thoroughly interprets and compares the learned rules with music theory.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,Proper analogies and examples help the reader perceive the ideas more easily.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"b) Cons: Although detailed definitions can be found in the authors' previous MUS-ROVER I papers, it would be great if they had described the optimization more clearly (in Figure 1. and related parts).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The ""(Conceptual-Hierarchy Filter)"" row in equations (3): the prime symbol should appear in the subscript.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,3. Originality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The representation of music concepts and rules is still an open area, the paper investigate the topic in a novel way.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"It illustrates an alternative besides other interpretable feature learning methods such as autoencoders, GAN, etc.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,4. Significance:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,It is good to see some corresponding interpretations for the learned rules from music theory.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The authors mentioned students in music could and should be involved in the self-learning loop to interact, which is very interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,I hope their advantages can be combined in the practice of music theory teaching and learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,This paper proposes an interesting framework (as a follow-up work of the author's previous paper) to learn compositional rules used to compose better music.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The system consists of two components, a generative component (student) and a discriminative component (teacher).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The generative component is a Probabilistic Graphical Models, generating the music following learned rules.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"The teacher compares the generated music with the empirical distribution of exemplar music (e.g, Bach’s chorales) and propose new rules for the student to learn so that it could improve.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,The framework is different from GANs that the both the generative and discriminative components are interpretable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"From the paper, it seems that the system can indeed learn sensible rules from the composed music and apply them in the next iteration, if trained in a curriculum manner.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"However, there is no comparison between the proposed system and its previous version, nor comparison between the proposed system and other simple baselines, e.g., an LSTM generative model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,This might pose a concern here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"I found this paper a bit hard to read, partly due to (1) lots of music terms (e.g, Tbl. 1 does not make sense to me) that hinders understanding of how the system performs, and (2) over-complicated math symbols and concept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"For example, In Page 4, the concept of raw/high-level feature, Feature-Induced Partition and Conceptual Hierarchy, all means a non-overlapping hierarchical clustering on the 4-dimensional feature space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"Also, there seems to be no hierarchy in Informational Hierarchy, but a list of rules.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,It would be much clearer if the authors write the paper in a plain way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,"Overall, the paper proposes a working system that seems to be interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryhqQFKgl,But I am not confident enough to give strong conclusions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,This paper propose a parallel mechanism for stochastic gradient descent method (SGD) in case of gradient can be computed via linear operations (including least square linear regression and polynomial regression problems).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"The motivation is to recover the same effect compared with sequential SGD, by using a proposed sound combiner.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"To make such combiner more efficient, the authors also use a randomized projection matrix to do dimension reduction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Experiments shows the proposed method has better speedup than previous methods like Hogwild! and Allreduce.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,I feel that there might be some fundamental misunderstanding on SGD.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,''The combiner matrixM  generate above can be quite large and expensive to compute.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"The sequential SGD algorithm maintains and updates the weight vector w , and thus requires O(f)  space and time, where f  is the number of features.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"In contrast,M  is a f f  matrix and consequently, the space and time complexity of parallel SGD is O(f^2) .",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"In practice, this would mean that we would need O(f) processors to see constant speedups, an infeasible proposition particularly for datasets that can have",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"thousands if not millions of features.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"I do not think one needs O(f^2) space and complexity for updating M_i * v, where v is an f-dimensional vector.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Note that M_i is a low rank matrix in the form of (I - a_i a_i').,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,The complexity and space can be reduced to O(f) if compute it by O(v - a_i (a_i' v)) equivalently.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,If M_i is defined in the form of the product of n number of rank 1 matrices.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,The complexity and space complexity is O(fn).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"In the context of this paper, n should be much smaller than f. I seriously doubt that all author's assumptions, experiments, and strategies in this paper are based on this incorrect assumption on space and complexity of SGD.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Why one can have speedup is unclear for me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,It is unclear what computations are in parallel and why this sequential algorithms can bring speedup if M_i*v is computed in the most efficient way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,I suggest authors to make the following changes to make this paper more clear and theoretically solid,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,provide computational complexity per step of the proposed algorithm,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,convergence rate analysis (convergence analysis is not enough): we would like to see how the dimension reduction can affect the complexity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"Overall, the idea in this paper is interesting and the paper is well-written and well-motivated.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"However, I think it is not ready to publish in ICLR for the following reasons:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,This paper is not related to representation learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,It may be more suitable for a general machine learning or data mining conference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"The proposed approach can only work for a small class of models and cannot apply to popular formulations,  such as SVM, logistic regression, and neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,It is unclear why we want to use SGD for this specific type of formulations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"For model like linear regression, the authors should compare their methods with linear programming approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"Also, it is unclear why we need to develope parallel algorithm for linear regressio problems as they are relatively easy to solve unless the data are big (see next comment).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,The dataset used in the paper are relatively small and can be only used for proving the concept.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Most datasets considered in the paper can be solved in a few second using a single core CPU.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Hogwild! is suitable for sparse dataset because of its asynchronized nature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"On data that are very sparse, the proposed approach is only slightly better or is worse than Hogwild.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"For dense dataset, it is unclear why we need to use SYMSGD instead of simply parallelizing the gradient computation using GPUs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"Put them together, the experiment results are not convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,This paper describes a correction technique to combine updates from multiple SGD to make it statistically equivalent to sequential technique.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,Comments,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,1) The proposed method is novel and interesting to allow update to be corrected even when the update is delayed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"2) The proposed theory can only be applied to square loss setting (with linear update rule), making it somewhat limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"This paper would be much more interesting to ICLR community, if the technique is applicable to general objective function and settings of deep neural networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"3) The resulting technique requires book-keeping of a dimensional reduced combiner matrix, which causes more computation in terms of complexity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,The authors argue that the overhead can be canceled with SIMD support for symbolic update.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"However, the normal update of SGD might also benefit from SIMD, especially when the dataset is dense.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,"Overall, even though the practical value of this work is limited by 2) and 3), the technique(specifically the correction rule) proposed in the paper could be of interest to people scaling up learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy1rwtKxg,I would encourage the author to extend the method to the cases of non-linear objective function which could make it more interesting to the ICLR community,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,This paper proposes a network called Gated Residual Networks layer design that adds gating to shortcut connections with a scalar to regulate the gate.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,The authors claim that this approach will improve the training Residual Networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,It seems the authors could get competitive performance on CIFAR-10 to state of art models with only Wide Res Nets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,Wide Gated ResNet requires much more parameters than DenseNet (and other Res Net variants) for obtaining a little improvement over Dense Net.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,"More importantly, the authors state that they obtained the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 but the updated version of DenseNet (Huang et al. (2016b)) has new results for a version called DenseNet-BC which outperforms all of the results that authors reported (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, DenseNet-BC still outperforms with 15.3M parameters which is much less that 36.5M).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,The Res Net variants papers with state of art results report result for Image Net.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,Therefore the empirical results need also the Image Net to demonstrate that improvement claimed is achieved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,The proposed trick adopts Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks with an intuitive motivation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,It is not sufficiently novel and the empirical results do not prove sufficient effectiveness of this incremental approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,This paper proposes to learn a single scalar gating parameter instead of a full gating tensor in highway networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,The claim is that such gating is easier to learn and allows a network to flexibly utilize computation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,The basic idea of the paper is simple and is clearly presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,"It is a natural simplification of highway networks to allow easily ""shutting off"" layers while keeping number of additional parameters low.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sywh5KYex,"However, in this regard the paper leaves out a few key points.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"For several algorithms, previous research has shown that the halting time follows a two-parameter distribution (the so-called universal property investigated by the authors).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"In this work, the authors extend the investigation to new algorithms (spin-glass, gradient descent in deep learning).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"An algorithm is considered to satisfy the universality property when the centered/scaled halting time fluctuations (empirical distribution of halting times) depend on the algorithm but do not depend on the target accuracy epsilon, an intrinsic measure of dimension N, the probability distribution/random ensemble.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"(This is clear from Eq 1 where on the left the empirical halting time distribution depends on epsilon, N, A, E and on the right, the approximation only depends on the algorithm)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"The authors argue that empirically, the universal property is observed when both algorithms (spin glass and deep learning) perform well and that it is not observed when they do not perform well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,A moment-based indicator is introduced to assess whether universality is observed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Review,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,This paper presents several problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,page 2: “[…] for sufficiently large N and eps = eps(N)”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The dependence of epsilon on N is troubling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,page 3: “Universality is a measure of stability in an algorithm […] For example […] halting time for the power method […] has infinite expectation and hence this type of universality is *not* present.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,One could use this to conclude that the power method is naive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Therefore the presence of universality is a desirable feature of a numerical method”,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,No.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,An algorithm is naive if there are better ways to answer the problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"One could not conclude from a halting time with infinite expectation (e.g. solving a problem extremely quickly 99% of the time, and looping forever in 1% of cases) or infinite variance, that the algorithm is naive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Moreover the universal property is more restrictive than having a finite halting time expectation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Even if in many specific cases, having a finite halting time expectation is a desirable property, showing that the presence of universality is desirable would require a demonstration that the other more restrictive aspects are also desirable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Also, the paragraph only concerns one algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,why would the conclusions generalise to all numerical methods ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Even if the universality property is arguably desirable (i.e. event if the conclusion of this paragraph is assumed correct), the paragraph does not support the given conclusion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Comparing Eq 1 and figures 2,3,4,5",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"From Eq 1, universality means that the centered/scaled halting time fluctuations (which depend on A, epsilon, N, E) can be approximated by a distribution that only depends on A (not on epsilon, N, E) but in the experiments only E varies (figures 2,3,4,5).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The validity of the approximation with varying epsilon or N is never tested,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"The ensembles/distributions parameter E (on which halting fluctuations should not depend) and the algorithm A (on which halting fluctuations are allowed to depend) are not well defined, especially w.r.t.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,In the optimisation setting we are told that the functional form of the landscape function is part of A (in answer to the question of a reviewer),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,but what is part of the functional form ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,what about computations where the landscape has no known functional form (black box) ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The conclusion claims that the paper “attempts to exhibit cases” where one can answer 5 questions in a robust and quantitative way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Question 1: “What are the conditions on the ensembles and the model that lead to such universality ?”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The only quantitative way would be to use the moments based indicator,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,however there is only one example of universality not being observed which concerns only one algorithm (conjugate gradient) and one type of failure (when M = N).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,This does not demonstrate robustness of the method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Question 2: “What constitutes a good set of hyper parameters for a given algorithm ?”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The proposed way to choose would be to test whether universality is observed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"If it is then the hyper parameters are good, if not the hyper parameters are bad.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The correspondance between bad hyper-parameters and observing no universality concerns only one algorithm and one type of failure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Other algorithms may fail in the universal regime or perform well in the non universal regime.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The paper does not show how to answer this question in a robust way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Question 3: ""How can we go beyond inspection when tuning a system ? """,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The question is too vague and general and there is probably no robust and quantitative way to answer it at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Question 4: ""How can we infer if an algorithm is a good match to the system at hand ? """,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The paper fails to demonstrate convincingly that universality is either a good or robust way to approach the very few studied algorithms.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The suggested generalisation to all systems and algorithms is extremely far fetched.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Question 5: ""What is the connection between the universal regime and the structure of the landscape ?""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"Same as before, the question is extremely vague and cannot be answered in a robust or quantitative way at all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The fact that what corresponds to A and what corresponds to E is not clear does not help.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,In the conclusion it is written that the paper validates the claim that universality is present in all or nearly all sensible computation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,It does not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The paper does not properly test whether universality is present (only 1 parameter in 3 that should not vary is tested).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,The paper does not properly test whether universality is lost when the computation is no longer sensible (only one failure case tested).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,Finally the experiments do not apply to all or nearly all computations but only to very few  specific algorithms.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"The idea of universality that is independent of input distribution and dimension, depending only on the algorithm is an appealing one.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"However, as an empirical study, this paper comes up somewhat short:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,1. Exactly one algorithm is shown for the deep learning example. It would have been more convincing to compare distributions with one or more algorithms.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"2. The definition (1),  and much of the work of Section 2.1 seems to have already been covered in Deift (2014), Section 1.3. In that paper, a number of different algorithms for the solution of linear systems are considered, and then the concept of universality becomes more plausible. I do not see enough of such algorithmic comparisons in this paper (same problem setup, different algorithms).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,3.  It seems to me that what practitioners might care about in practice are both the mean and variance in running times; these quantities are buried in (1). So I question how useful the distribution itself might be for algorithm tuning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyET6tYex,"At the least, many more empirical comparisons should be provided to convince me that the universality holds across a broad range of algorithms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,This paper presents a theoretical and empirical approach to the problem of understanding the expressivity of deep networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"Random networks (deep networks with random Gaussian weights, hard tanh or ReLU activation) are studied according to several criterions: number of neutron transitions, activation patterns, dichotomies and trajectory length.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,There doesn't seem to be a solid justification for why the newly introduced measures of expressivity really measure expressivity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,For instance the trajectory length seems a very discutable measure of expressivity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The only justification given for why it should be a good measure of expressivity is proportionality with other measures of expressivity in the specific case of random networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The paper is too obscure and too long.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The work may have some interesting ideas but it does not seem to be properly replaced in context.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,It is not clear how the representative power of random networks (what kind of random networks seems an important question here) is linked to the representative power of (i) of the whole class of networks or (ii) the class of networks after training.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Theorem 6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,As far as I remember Stanley also provides an elementary proof of case with hyperplanes in general position.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Many other works also provide elementary proofs using the same induction arguments in what is known as the sweep hyperplane method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Summary of the paper:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Authors study in this paper quantities related to the expressivity of neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The analysis is done for a random network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,authors define the ‘trajectory length’ of a one dimensional trajectory as the length of the trajectory as the points (in a m- dimensional space) are embedded by layers of the network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"They provide growth factors as function of hidden units k, and number of layers d.  the growth factor is exponential in the number of layers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"Authors relates this trajectory length to authors quantities : ‘transitions’,’activation patterns ’ and ‘Dichotomies’.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,As a consequence of this study authors suggest that training only  earlier layers in the network  leads higher accuracy then just training later layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Experiments are presented on MNIST and CIFAR10.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Clarity:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"The  paper is a little hard to follow, since  the motivations are not clear in the introduction and the definitions across the paper are not clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Novelty:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Studying the trajectory length as function of transforming the data by a multilayer network is   new and interesting idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"The relation to transition numbers is in term of the growth factor, and not as a quantity to quantity relationship.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Hence it is hard to understand what are the implications.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Significance:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The geometry of the input set (of dimension m)  shows up only weakly in the activation patterns analysis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The trajectory study should tell us how the network organizes the input set.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,As observed in the experiments the network becomes contractive/selective as we train the network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"It would be interesting to study those phenomenas using this trajectory length , as a measure for disentangling nuisance factors ( such as invariances etc.).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"In the supervised setting the network need not to be contractive every where , so it needs to be selective to the class label, a  theoretical study of the selectivity and contraction using the trajectory length would be more appealing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Theorem 1:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,As raised by reviewer one the definition of a one dimensional input trajectory is missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,What does theorem 1 tells us about the design and the architecture to use in neural networks as promised in the introduction is not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,The connection to transitions in Theorem 2 is rather weak.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Theorem 2:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"in the proof of theorem 2 it not clear what is meant by T and t. Notations are confusing, the expectation is taken with respect to which weight: is it W_{d+1} or (W_{d+1} and W_{d})?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,I understand you don't want to overload notation but maybe E_{d+1} can help keeping track.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"I don't see how the recursion is applied if T and t in it, have different definitions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,seems T_{d+1} for you is a random variable and t_{d} is fixed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Are you fixing W_d,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,and then looking at W_{d+1} as  random?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,In the same proof:  the recursion  is for d>1  ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"your analysis is for W \in R^{k\times k}, you don't not study the W \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times m}.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,In this case you can not assume assume that |z^(0)|=1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"should d=1, be analyzed alone to know how it scales with m?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Theorem 4 in main text:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Is the proof missing?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,or Theorem 4 in the main text is Theorem 6 in the appendix?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,Figures 8 and 9:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,the trajectory length reduction in the training isn't that just the network becoming contractive to enable mapping the training points to the labels?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,See for instance  on contraction in deep networks https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04920.pdf,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,How much the plot depends on the shape of the trajectory?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,have you tried other then circular trajectory?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,In these plots the 2 mnist points had same label ? or different label?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1TTpYKgx,"both cases should be studied, to see the tradeoff between contraction and selectivity to the class label.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,Deep RL (using deep neural networks for function approximators in RL algorithms) have had a number of successes solving RL in large state spaces.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,This empirically driven work builds on these approaches.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,It introduces a new algorithm which performs better in novel 3D environments from raw sensory data and allows better generalization across goals and environments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"Notably, this algorithm was the winner of the Visual Doom AI competition.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,The key idea of their algorithm is to use additional low-dimensional observations (such as ammo or health which is provided by the game engine) as a supervised target for prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"Importantly, this prediction is conditioned on a goal vector (which is given, not learned) and the current action.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,Once trained the optimal action for the current state can be chosen as the action that maximises the predicted outcome according the goal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"Unlike in successor feature representations, learning is supervised and there is no TD relationship between the predictions of the current state and the next state.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,There have been a number of prior works both in predicting future states as part of RL and goal driven function approximators which the authors review in section 2.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"The key contributions of this work are the focus on Monte Carlo estimation (rather than TD), the use of low-dimensional ‘measurements’ for prediction, the parametrized goals and, perhaps most importantly, the empirical comparison to relevant prior work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"In addition to the comparison with Visual Doom AI, the authors show that their algorithm is able to learn generalizable policies which can respond, without further training, to limited changes in the goal.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,The paper is well-communicated and the empirical results compelling and will be of significant interest.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,Some minor potential improvements:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"There is an approximation in the supervised training as it is making an on-policy assumption but it learns from a replay buffer (with the Monte Carlo regression the expectation of the remainder of the trajectory is assumed to follow the current policy, but is being sampled from episodes generated by prior versions of the policy).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,This should be discussed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,The algorithm uses additional metadata (the information about which parts of the sensory input are worth predicting) that the compared algorithms do not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"I think this, and the limitations of this approach (e.g. it may not work well in a sensory environment if such measurements are not provided) should be mentioned more clearly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,This paper presents an on-policy deep RL method with additional auxiliary intrinsic variables.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,The method is a special case of an universal value function based approach and the authors do cite the correct references.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,Maybe the biggest claimed technical contribution of this paper is to distill many of the existing ideas to solve 3D navigation problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,I think the contributions should be more clearly stated in the abstract/intro,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,I would have liked to see failure modes of this approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,Under what circumstances does the model have problems generalizing to changing goals?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,There are other conceptual problems,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"since this is an on-policy method, there will be catastrophic forgetting if the agent dosen't repeatedly train on goals from the distant past.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"Since the main contribution of this paper is to integrate several key ideas and show empirical advantage, I would have liked to see results on other domains like Atari (maybe using the ROM as intrinsic variables)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"Overall, I think this paper does show clear empirical advantage of using the proposed underlying formulations and experimental insights from this paper might be valuable for future agents",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,The paper presents an on-policy method to predict future intrinsic measurements.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"All the experiments are performed in the game of Doom (vizDoom to be exact), and instead of just predicting win/loss or the number of frags (score), the authors trained their model to predict (a sequence of) triplets of (health, ammunition, frags), weighted by (a sequence of) ""goal"" triplets that they provided as input.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"- There is an ablation study that supports the thesis that all the ""added complexity"" of the paper's model is useful.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,A few comments (nitpicks) on the form:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"- Doom is described as a 3D environment, whereas it is actually a 2D environment (the height is not a discriminative/actionable dimension) presented in (fake) 3D.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"- The use of ""P"" in (2) (and subsequently) may be misleading as it stands for prediction but not probability (as is normally the case for P).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"- The double use of ""j"" (admittedly, with different fonts) in (6) may be misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,- Results tables could repeat the units of the measurements (in particular as they are heterogenous in Table 1).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLS7qKel,"One could argue that experiments could be conducted on different environments or that the novelty is limited, but I feel that ""correct"" (no-nonsense, experimentally sound on Doom, appendix providing details for reproducibility) and ""milestone"" (vizDoom winner) papers should get published.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,This paper proposes an extension of the MAC method in which subproblems are trained on a distributed cluster arranged in a circular configuration.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,The basic idea of MAC is to decouple the optimization between parameters and the outputs of sub-pieces of the model (auxiliary coordinates); optimization alternates between updating the coordinates given the parameters and optimizing the parameters given the outputs.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"Parallel SGD also has the benefit that it's extremely easy to implement on top of NN toolboxes, so this has to work a lot better to be practically useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"Also, it's a bit hard to understand what exactly is being passed around from round to round, and what the trade-offs would be in a deep feed-forward network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"Assuming you have one sub-problem for every hidden unit, then it seems like:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"1. In the W step, different bits of the NN walk their way around the cluster, taking SGD steps w.r.t. the coordinates stored on each machine. This means passing around the parameter vector for each hidden unit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"2. Then there's a synchronization step to gather the parameters from each submodel, requiring a traversal of the circular structure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"3. Then each machine updates it's coordinates based on the complete model for a slice of the data. This would mean, for a feed-forward network, producing the intermediate activations of each layer for each data point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"So for something comparable to parallel SGD, you could do the following: put a mini-batch of size B on each machine with ParMAC, compared to running such mini-batches in parallel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"Completing steps 1-2-3 above would then be roughly equivalent to one synchronized PS type implementation step (distribute model to workers, get P gradients back, update model.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,It would be really helpful to see how this compares in practice.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"It's hard for me to understand intuitively why the proposed method is theoretically any better than parallel SGD (except for the issue of non-smooth function optimization); the decoupling also can fundamentally change the problem since you're not doing back-propagation directly anymore, so that seems like it would conflate things as well and it's not necessarily going to just work for other types of architectures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"This paper proposes a novel approach ParMAC, a parallel and distributed framework of MAC (the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates) to learn nested and non-convex models which is based on the composition of multiple processing layers (i.e., deep nets).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"The basic idea of MAC to optimise the nested objective function, which is traditionally learned using methods based on the chain-rule gradients but inconvenient and is hard to parallelise, is to break nested functional relationships judiciously by introducing new variables ( the auxiliary coordinates) as equality constraints, and then to optimise a penalised function using alternating optimisation over the original parameters (W step) and over the coordinates (Z step).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"The minimisation (W step) updates the parameters by splitting the nested model into independent submodels and training them using existing algorithms, and the coordination (Z step) ensures that corresponding inputs and outputs of submodels eventually match.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"In this paper, the basic assumptions of ParMAC are that with large datasets in distributed systems, it is imperative to minimise data movement over the network because of the communication time generally far exceeds the computation time in modern architectures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"Thus, the authors propose the ParMAC to translate the parallelism inherent in MAC into a distributed system by data parallelism and model parallelism.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygvTcYee,"They also analyse its parallel speedup and convergence, and demonstrated it with MPI-based implementation to optimise binary autoencoders.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,This work offers a theoretical justification for reusing the input word embedding in the output projection layer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,It does by proposing an additional loss that is designed to minimize the distance between the predictive distribution and an estimate of the true data distribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,This is a nice setup since it can effectively smooth over the labels given as input.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,"However, the construction of the estimate of the true data distribution seems engineered to provide the weight tying justification in Eqs. 3.6 and 3.7.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,This paper gives a theoretical motivation for tieing the word embedding and output projection matrices in RNN LMs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,The argument uses an augmented loss function which spreads the output probability mass among words with close word-embedding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,I see two main drawbacks from this framework:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aPbsFle,The augmented loss function has no trainable parameters and is used for only for regularization.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,The work proposes to use the geometry of data (that is considered to be known a priori) in order to have more consistent sparse coding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Namely, two data samples that are similar or neighbours, should have a sparse code that is similar (in terms of support).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"The general idea is not unique, but it is an interesting one (if one admits that the adjacency matrix A is known a priori), and the novelty mostly lies on the definition of the regularisation term that is an l1-norm (while other techniques would mostly use l2 regularisation).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Based on this idea, the authors develop a new SRSC algorithm, which is analysed in detail and shown to perform better than its competitors based on l2 sparse coding regularisation and other schemes in terms of clustering performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Inspired by LISTA, the authors then propose an approximate solution to the SRSC problem, called Deep-SRSC, that acts as a sort of fast encoder.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Here too, the idea is interesting and seems to be quite efficient from experiments on USPS data, even if the framework seems to be strongly inspired from LISTA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"That scheme should however be better motivated, by the limitations of SRSC that should be presented more clearly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Overall, the paper is well written, and pretty complete.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"It is not extremely original in its main ideas though, but the actual algorithm and implementation seem new and effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,In this paper the authors propose a method to explicitly regularize sparse coding to encode neighbouring datapoints with similar sets of atoms from the dictionary by clustering training examples with KNN in input space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"The resulting algorithm is relatively complex and computationally relatively expensive, but the authors provide detailed derivations and use arguments from proximal gradient descent methods to prove convergence (I did not follow all the derivations, only some).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,In general the paper is well written and the authors explain the motivation behind the algorithms design in detail.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"In the abstract the authors mention “extensive experimental results …”, but I find the experiments not very convincing: With experiments on the USPS handwritten digits dataset (why not MNIST?), COIL-20 and COIL-100 and UCI, the datasets are all relatively small and the algorithm is run with dictionary sizes between p=100 to p=500.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,This seems surprising because the authors state that they implemented SRSC in “CUDA C++ with extreme efficiency” (page 10).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"But more importantly, I find it hard to interpret and compare the results: The paper reports accuracy and and normalized mutual information for a image retrieval / clustering task where the proposed SRSC is used as a feature extractor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"The improvements relative to standard Sparse Coding seem very small  (often < 1% in terms of NMI; it looks more promising in terms of accuracy) and if I understand the description on page 11 correctly, than the test set was used to select some hyperparameters (the best similarity measure for clustering step)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,There is no comparisons to other baselines / state of the art image clustering methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Besides of providing features for a small scale image clustering system, are there maybe ways to more directly evaluate the properties and qualities of  a sparse coding approach?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,E.g. reconstruction error / sparsity; maybe even denoising performance?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"In summary, I think in it current form the paper lacks the evaluation and experimental results for an ICLR publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkljfjFee,"Intuitively, I agree with the authors that the proposed regularization is an interesting direction, but I don’t see experiments that directly show that the regularization has the desired effect; and the improvements in the clustering task where SRSC is used as a feature extractor are very modest.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJWzXsKxx,"From Figure 5, it is clear that all models achieve minimal validation loss after around 10k iterations, after which the validation losses increase, suggesting that the models have slightly overfit the training data by the end of training.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,And simple by-pass is like ResNet bottlenecks and complex by-pass is like inception modules in GoogLeNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,Can we say that these two valiants of SqueezeNet are adaptation of concepts seen in GoogLeNet and ResNet?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"If so, then shouldn’t be there a SqueezeNet like model that achieves similar accuracy compared with GoogLeNet and ResNet?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"The Squeezenet paper came out in Feb 2016, and I read it with interest.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,It has a series of completely reasonable engineering suggestions for how to save parameter memory for CNNs for object recognition (imagenet).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"The suggestions make a lot of sense, and provide an excellent compression of about 50x versus AlexNet.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"(Looks like ~500x if combined with Han, 2015).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"So, very nice results, definitely worth publishing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"Since the arxiv paper came out, people have noticed and worked to extend the paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,This is already evidence that this paper will have impact,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,and deserves to have a permanent published home.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"On the negative side, the architecture was only tested on ImageNet",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"unclear whether the ideas transfer to other tasks (e.g., audio or text recognition).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"And, as with many other architecture-tweaking papers, there is no real mathematical or theoretical support for the ideas: they are just sensible and empirically work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xh5sYgx,"Oh the whole, I think the paper deserves to appear at ICLR, being in the mainline of work on deep learning architectures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,This paper proposes a simple domain adaptation technique in which batch normalization is performed separately in each domain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The method is very simple and easy to understand and apply.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The experiments demonstrate that the method compares favorably with existing methods on standard domain adaptation tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The analysis in section 4.3.2 shows that a very small number of target domain samples are needed for adaptation of the network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,There is little novelty,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,the method is arguably too simple to be called a “method.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"Rather, it’s the most straightforward/intuitive approach when using a network with batch normalization for domain adaptation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The alternative,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,using the BN statistics from the source domain for target domain examples,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"is less natural, to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,(I guess this alternative is what’s done in the Inception BN results in Table 1-2?),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The analysis in section 4.3.1 is superfluous except as a sanity check,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"KL divergence between the distributions should be 0 when each distribution is shifted/scaled to N(0,1) by BN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Section 3.3: it’s not clear to me what point is being made here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"Overall, there’s not much novelty here, but it’s hard to argue that simplicity is a bad thing when the method is clearly competitive with or outperforming prior work on the standard benchmarks (in a domain adaptation tradition that started with “Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation”).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"If accepted, Sections 4.3.1 and 3.3 should be removed or rewritten for clarity for a final version.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Update: I thank the authors for their comments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"I still think that the method needs more experimental evaluation: for now, it's restricted to the settings in which one can use pre-trained ImageNet model, but it's also important to show the effectiveness in scenarios where one needs to train everything from scratch.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"I would love to see a fair comparison of the state-of-the-art methods on toy datasets (e.g. see (Bousmalis et al., 2016), (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015)).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"In my opinion, it's a crucial point that doesn't allow me to increase the rating.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,This paper proposes a simple trick turning batch normalization into a domain adaptation technique.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,The authors show that per-batch means and variances normally computed as a part of the BN procedure are sufficient to discriminate the domain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,This observation leads to an idea that adaptation for the target domain can be performed by replacing population statistics computed on the source dataset by the corresponding statistics from the target dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"Overall, I think the paper is more suitable for a workshop track rather than for the main conference track.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,My main concerns are the following:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"1. Although the main idea is very simple, it feels like the paper is composed in such a way to make the main contribution less obvious (e.g. the idea could have been described in the abstract but the authors avoided doing so).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"2. (This one is from the pre-review questions) The authors are using much stronger base CNN which may account for the bulk of the reported improvement. In order to prove the effectiveness of the trick, the authors would need to conduct a fair comparison against competing methods. It would be highly desirable to conduct this comparison also in the case of a model trained from scratch (as opposed to reusing ImageNet-trained networks).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Overall I think this is an interesting paper which shows empirical performance improvement over baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"However, my main concern with the paper is regarding its technical depth, as the gist of the paper can be summarized as the following: instead of keeping the batch norm mean and bias estimation over the whole model, estimate them on a per-domain basis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"I am not sure if this is novel, as this is a natural extension of the original batch normalization paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Overall I think this paper is more fit as a short workshop presentation rather than a full conference paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Section 3.1: I respectfully disagree that the core idea of BN is to align the distribution of training data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"It does this as a side effect, but the major purpose of BN is to properly control the scale of the gradient so we can train very deep models without the problem of vanishing gradients.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,It is plausible that intermediate features from different datasets naturally show as different groups in a t-SNE embedding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,This is not the particular feature of batch normalization: visualizing a set of intermediate features with AlexNet and one gets the same results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,So the premise in section 3.1 is not accurate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Section 3.3: I have the same concern as the other reviewer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,It seems to be quite detatched from the general idea of AdaBN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"Equation 2 presents an obvious argument that the combined BN-fully_connected layer forms a linear transform, which is true in the original BN case and in this case as well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,I do not think it adds much theoretical depth to the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,(In general the novelty of this paper seems low),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,Experiments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"section 4.3.1 is not an accurate measure of the ""effectiveness"" of the proposed method, but a verification of a simple fact: previously, we normalize the source domain features into a Gaussian distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,the proposed method is explicitly normalizing the target domain features into the same Gaussian distribution as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"So, it is obvious that the KL divergence between these two distributions are closer - in fact, one is *explicitly* making them close.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"However, this does not directly correlate to the effectiveness of the final classification performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"section 4.3.2: the sensitivity analysis is a very interesting read, as it suggests that only a very few number of images are needed to account for the domain shift in the AdaBN parameter estimation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"This seems to suggest that a single ""whitening"" operation is already good enough to offset the domain bias (in both cases shown, a single batch is sufficient to recover about 80% of the performance gain, although I cannot get data for even smaller number of examples from the figure).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJuysoFeg,"It would thus be useful to have a comparison between these approaches, and also a detailed analysis of the effect from each layer of the model - the current analysis seems a bit thin.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The paper proposes a nonlinear regularizer for solving ill-posed inverse problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The latent variables (or causal factors) corresponding to the observed data are assumed to lie near a low dimensional subspace in an RKHS induced by a predetermined kernel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The proposed regularizer can be seen as an extension of the linear low-rank assumption on the latent factors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,A nuclear norm penalty on the Cholesky factor of the kernel matrix is used as a relaxation for the dimensionality of the subspace.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Empirical results are reported on two tasks involving linear inverse problems,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"missing feature imputation, and estimating non-rigid 3D structures from a sequence of 2D orthographic projections",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,and the proposed method is shown to outperform linear low-rank regularizer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The clarity of the paper has scope for improvement (particularly, Introduction) - the back and forth b/w dimensionality reduction techniques and inverse problems is confusing at times.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Clearly defining the ill-posed inverse problem first and then motivating the need for a regularizer (which brings dimensionality reduction techniques into the picture) may be a more clear flow in my opinion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The motivation behind relaxation of rank() in Eq 1 to nuclear-norm in Eq 2 is not clear to me in this setting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The relaxation does not yield a convex problem over S,C (Eq 5) and also increases the computations (Algo 2 needs to do full SVD of K(S)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,every time).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The authors should discuss pros/cons over the alternate approach that fixes the rank of C (which can be selected using cross-validation, in the same way as  is selected), leaving just the first two terms in Eq 5.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"For this simpler objective, an interesting question to ask would be",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,are there kernel functions for which it can solved in a scalable manner?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The proposed alternating optimization approach in the current form is computationally intensive and seems hard to scale to even moderate sized data,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,in every iteration one needs to compute the kernel matrix over S and perform full SVD over the kernel matrix (Algo 2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Empirical evaluations are also not extensive,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"(i) the dataset used for feature imputation is old and non-standard, (ii) for structure estimation from motion on CMU dataset, the paper only compares with linear low-rank regularization, (iii) there is no comment/study on the convergence of the alternating procedure (Algo 1).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,This paper considers an alternate formulation of Kernel PCA with rank constraints incorporated as a regularization term in the objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The writing is not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The focus keeps shifting from estimating “causal factors”, to nonlinear dimensionality reduction to Kernel PCA to ill-posed inverse problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The problem reformulation of Kernel PCA uses somewhat standard tricks and it is not clear what are the advantages of the proposed approach over the existing methods as there is no theoretical analysis of the overall approach or empirical comparison with existing state-of-the-art.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Not sure what the authors mean by “causal factors”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,There is a reference to it in Abstract and in Problem formulation on page 3 without any definition/discussion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"In KPCA, I am not sure why one is interested in step (iii) outlined on page 2 of finding a pre-image for each",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Authors outline two key disadvantages of the existing KPCA approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The first one, that of low-dimensional manifold assumption not holding exactly, has received lots of attention in the machine learning literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,It is common to assume that the data lies near a low-dimensional manifold rather than on a low-dimensional manifold.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Second disadvantage is somewhat unclear as finding “a data point (pre-image) corresponding to each projection in the input space” is not a standard step in KPCA.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"On page 3, you never define , , .",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"Clearly, they cannot be cartesian products.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,I have to assume that notation somehow implies N-tuples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"On page 3, Section 2,  and  are sets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,What do you mean by,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"On page 5,  is never defined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Experiments: None of the standard algorithms for matrix completion such as OptSpace or SVT were considered,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Experiments: There is no comparison with alternate existing approaches for Non-rigid structure from motion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Proof of the main result Theorem 3.1:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,To get from (16) to (17) using the Holder inequality (as stated) one would end up with a term that involves sum of fourth powers of weights w_{ij}.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Why would they equal to one using the orthonormal constraints?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"It would be useful to give more details here, as I don’t see how the argument goes through at this point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,This paper presents an approach to non-linear kernel dimensionality reduction with a trace norm regularizer in the feature space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The authors proposed an iterative minimization approach in order to obtain a local optimum of a relaxed problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The paper contains errors and the experimental evaluation is not convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,Only old techniques are compared against in very toy datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The authors claim state-of-the-art, however, the oil dataset is not a real benchmark, and the comparisons are to very old approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"The experimental evaluation should demonstrate robustness to more complex noise and outliers, as this was one of the motivations in the introduction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The authors do not address the out-of-sample problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"This is a problem of kernel-based methods vs LVMs, and thus should be address here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The paper contains errors:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The last paragraph of section 1 says that this paper proposes a closed form solution to robust KPCA.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"This is simply wrong, as the proposed approach consists of iteratively solving iterativey a set of closed form updates  and Levenberg-Marquard optimizationd.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,This is not any more closed form!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,In the same paragraph (and later in the text) the authors claim that the proposed approach can be trivially generalized to incorporate other cost functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"This is not true, as in general there will be no more inner loop closed form updates and the authors will need to solve a much more complex optimization problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The third paragraph of section 2 claims that this paper presents a novel energy minimization framework to solve problems of the general form of eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,(2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"However, this is not what the authors solve at the end.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,They solve a different problem that has been subject to at least two relaxations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,It is not clear how solving for a local optima of this double relaxed problem is related to the original problem they want to solve.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,The paper says that Geiger et al defined non linearities on a latent space of pre-defined dimensionality.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,This is wrong.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,This paper discovers the dimensionality of the latent space by means of a regularizer that encourages the singular values to be sparse.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"Thus, it does not have a fixed dimensionality, the latent space is just bounded to be smaller or equal than the dimensionality of the original space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"It is not clear to me why the author say for LVMs such as GPLVM that ""the latent space is learned a priority with clean training data"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,One can use different noise models within the GP framework.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"Furthermore, the proposed approach assumes Gaussian noise (see eq. 6), which is also the trivial case for GP-based LVMs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"It is not clear what the authors mean in the paper by ""pre-training"" or saying that techniques do not have a training phase.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2iistgg,"KPCA is trained via a closed-form update, but there is still training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,This paper presents an approach which modifies the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework so as to use stochastic latent dimensionality.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"This is achieved by using an inherently infinite prior, the stick-breaking process.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"This is coupled with inference tailored to this model, specifically the Kumaraswamy distribution as an approximate variational posterior.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"The resulting model is named the SB-VAE which also has a semi-supervised extension, in similar vein to the original VAE paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"There's a lot of interest in VAEs these days; many lines of work seek to achieve automatic ""black-box"" inference in these models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"For example, the authors themselves mention parallel work by Blei's lab (also others) towards this direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"However, there's a lot of merit in investigating more bespoke solutions to new models, which is what the authors are doing in this paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Indeed, a (useful) side-effect of providing efficient inference for the SB-VAE is drawing attention to the use of the Kumaraswamy distribution which hasn't been popular in ML.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Although the paper is in general well structured, I found it confusing at parts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,I think the major source of confusion comes from the fact that the model specification and model inference are discussed in a somehow mixed manner.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The pre-review questions clarified most parts.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,I have two main concerns regarding the methodology and motivation of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Firstly, conditioning the model directly on the stick-breaking weights seems a little odd.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"I initially thought that there was some mixture probabilistic model involved, but this is not the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"To be fair, the authors discuss about this issue (which became clearer to me after the pre-review questions), and explain that they're investigating the apparently challenging problem of using a base distribution G_0.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The question is whether their relaxation is still useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"From the experiments it seems that the method is at least competitive, so the answer is yes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Hopefully an extension will come in the future, as the authors mention.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The second concern is about the motivation of this method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,It seems that the paper fails to clearly explain in a convincing way why it is beneficial to reformulate the VAE as a SB-VAE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"I understand that the non-parametric property induced by the prior might result in better capacity control, however I feel that this advantage (and potentially others which are still unclear to me) is not sufficiently explained and demonstrated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,Perhaps some comparison with a dropout approach or a more thorough discussion related to dropout would make this clearer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Overall, I found this to be an interesting paper, it would be a good fit for ICLR.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The paper attempts to combine Variational Auto-Encoders with the Stick-Breaking process.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The motivation is to tackle the component collapsing and have a representation with stochastic dimensionality.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"To demonstrate the merit of their approach, the authors test this model on MNIST and SVHN in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"After reading the paper in more detail, I find that the claim that the dimensionality of the latent variable is stochastic does not seem quite correct: all latent variables are ""used"" (which actually enable backpropagation)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,but the latent variables are parametrized differently (into ) and the decoding process is altered as to give the impression of sparsity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,The way all these latent variables are used does not involve any marginalization but is very similar to the common soft-gating mechanism already used in LSTM or attentional model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,With respect to the Figure 5b showing the decoder input weights: component collapsing probably does not have the same effect as Gaussian prior.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"is positive therefore having a very small average value might mean that its value is close to zero most of the time, not requiring any update on the weight.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"For the standard Gaussian prior, component collapsing means having a very noisy input with no signal involved, which forces the decoder to shut down this channel, i.e. have small incoming weights from this collapsed variable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,Adding a histogram of the latent variables in addition to that might help decide if the associated weights are relatively large because they are actually used or if it's because the inputs are zero anyway.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"The semi-supervised results are better than a weaker version of the model used in (Kingma et al., 2014), but as to have a fairer comparison, the results should be compared with the M1+M2 model in that paper, even if that requires also using two VAEs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"Summary: This is the first work to investigate stick-breaking priors, and corresponding inference methods, for use in VAEs. The background material is explained clearly, as well as the explanation of the priors and posteriors and their DNCP forms. The paper is really well written.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,"In experiments, they find that stick-breaking priors does not generally improve upon spherically Gaussian priors in the completely unsupervised setting, when measured w.r.t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1jmAotxg,log-likelihood.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,I can see the utility of this model as bringing together two elements: multi-view modeling and VAEs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,This seems like an obvious idea but to the best of my knowledge it hasn't been done before and is actually a potentially very useful model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"However, the question is, what is the proper way of extending VAE to multiple views?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,The paper didn't convince me that VAE can work well with multiple views using the shown straightforward construction.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Specifically, VCCA doesn't seem to promote the state of the art in terms of results (it actually is overall below the SOA), while the VCCA-private seems a quite ill-posed model: the dimensionalities d have to be manually tuned with exhaustive search; further, the actual model does not provide a consinstent way of encouraging the private and common variables to avoid learning redundant information.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Relying only on dropout for this seems a quite ad-hoc solution (in fact, from Fig. 4 (ver2) it seems that the dropout rate is quite crucial).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Perhaps good performance might be achieved with a lot of tuning (which might be why the FLICKR results got better in ver2 without changing the model), but it seems quite difficult to optimize for the above reasons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"From a purely experimental point of view, VCCA-private doesn't seem to promote the SOA either.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Of course one wouldn't expect any new published paper to beat all previous baselines, but it seems that extension of VAE to multiple views is a very interesting idea which deserves some more investigation of how to do it efficiently.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Another issue is the approximate posterior being parameterized only from one of the views.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"This makes the model less useful as a generic multi-view model, since it will misbehave in tasks other than classification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"But if classification is the main objective, then one should compare to a proper classification model, e.g. a feedforward neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,The plots of Fig. 8 are very nice.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Overall, the paper convinced me that there is merit in attaching multiple views to VAE.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"However, it didn't convince me a) that the proposed way to achieve this is practical b) that there is a connection to CCA (other than being a method for multiple views).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"The bottom line is that, although the paper is interesting, it needs a little more work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,UPDATE: I have read the replies on this thread.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,My opinion has not changed.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Since the development of black box variational inference and variational auto-encoders, the methodology in model-specific papers like this one are arguably not very interesting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,The model is a straightforward extension of probabilistic CCA with neural net parameterized likelihoods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Inference is mechanically the same as any black box approach using the reparameterization gradient and inference networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"The approach also uses a mean-field approximation, which is quite old given the many recent developments in more expressive approximations (see, e.g., Rezende and Mohamed (2015); Tran et al. (2016)).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"The connection to multi-view auto encoders is at first insightful, but no more than the difference between MAP and variational inference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"This is a well-known insight: in the abstract, the authors argue that the key distinction is the additional sampling, but ultimately what matters is the KL regularizer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"Even with noisy samples, the variances of a normal variational approximation would collapse to zero and thus become a point mass approximation, equivalent to optimizing a point estimate from the MVAE objective.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"This paper describes the use of variational autoencoders for multi-view representation learning as an alternative to canonical correlation analysis (CCA), deep CCA (DCCA), and multi-view autoencoders (MVAE).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Two variants of variational autoencoders (which the authors call VCCA and VCCA-private) are investigated.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"The method’s performances are compared on a synthetic MNIST dataset, the XRMB speech-articulation dataset, and the MIR-Flickr dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Variational autoencoders are widely used and their performance for multi-view representation learning should be of interest to the ICLR community.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,The paper is well written and clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,The experiments are thorough.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,It is interesting that the performance of MVAE and VCCA is quite different given the similarity of their objective functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,I further find the analyses of the effects of dropout and private variables useful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"As the authors point out, “VCCA does not optimize the same criterion, nor produce the same solution, as any linear or nonlinear CCA”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"It would have been interesting to discuss the differences of a linear variant of VCCA and linear CCA, and to compare it quantitatively.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"While it might not make sense to use variational inference in the linear case, it would nevertheless help to understand the differences better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"The derivations in Equation 3 and Equation 13 seem unnecessarily detailed given that VCCA and VCCA-p are special cases of VAE, only with certain architectural constraints.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Perhaps move to the Appendix?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"In Section 3 the authors claim that “if we are able to generate realistic samples from the learned distribution, we can infer that we have discovered the underlying structure of the data”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"This is not correct, a model which hasn’t learned a thing can have perfectly realistic samples (see Theis et al., 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Please remove or revise the sentence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,Minor:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Heentlx,"In the equation between Equation 8 and 9, using notation N(x; g(z, theta), I) as in Equation 6 would make it clearer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The paper details an implementation of sparse-full convolutions and a model to work out the potential speed-up of various sparsity levels for CNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"The first contribution is more about engineering, but the authors make the source code available which is greatly appreciated.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"The second contribution is perhaps more interesting, as so far pruning methods have focused on saving memory, with very modest speed gains.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,Imbuing knowledge of running speed into a pruning algorithm seems like the proper way to tackle this problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The authors are very methodical in how they build the model and evaluate it very thoroughly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"It seems that the same idea could be used not just for pruning existing models, but also when building new architectures: selecting layers and their parameters as to achieve an optimal throughput rate.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,This could make for a nice direction for future work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,One point that is missing is some discussion of how transferable the performance model is to GPUs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,This would make the technique easier to adopt broadly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"Other areas for improvement: The points in Figure 4 are hard to distinguish (e.g. small red circle vs. small red square), and overall the figure could be made bigger; specifying whether the ""base learning rate"" in Section 3 is the start or end rate of the annealing schedule; typos: ""punning"" (p.4), ""spares"" (p.5).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The authors provide a well engineered solution to exploiting sparsity in convolutional layers of a deep network by recasting it as sparse matrix-vector multiplication.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,This leads to very nice speedups and the analysis of when this is possible is also useful for practitioners.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"My main concern with this paper is that the ""research"" aspect of it seems rather minimal, and it's mostly about performance engineering and comparisons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,It is upto the area chairs to decide how well such a paper fits in at ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,This paper tackles the problem of compressing trained convnets with the goal of reducing memory overhead and speeding up the forward pass.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,"As I understand it, the main contribution of this work is to develop fast convolution routines for sparse conv weights int he case of general sparsity (as compared with structured sparsity).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,They evaluate their method on both AlexNet and GoogLeNet as well as on various platforms.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The authors make code available online.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The paper is well written and does a good job of putting this work in the context of past model reduction techniques.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,My main request of the authors would be to provide a concise summary of the speedup/memory gains achievable with this new work compared with previously published work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJPcZ3txx,The authors do show the various sparsity level obtained with various methods of pruning but it is unclear to me how to translate the information given in the paper into an understanding of gains relative to other methods.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,+This is is well written and more of ideas are clearly presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,+It demonstrates an interesting application of LSTM sequential modeling to HIDS problem,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,The overall novelty is limited considering the major technical components like LSTM RNN and ensemble method are already established.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,The contribution of the proposed ensemble method needs further evaluation because it is also possible to use ensemble ideas in kNN and kMC baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,The authors propose using an LSTM on a sequence of system calls to perform network intrusion detection (NIDS).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,The idea of using neural networks (in general) for NIDS is old [1].,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,"The paper in [2] operates on counts of N-grams of system calls, rather than on the raw sequence, but that pre-processing does not seem ""heavy"" to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,"Overall, the proposed system works as well as other proposed NIDS system, and the paper checks portability (which is good).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,"But, on the con side, I don't see this paper as adding a lot to the state-of-the-art in NIDS.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rksfwnFxl,I didn't learn a lot about representations from this paper: many people have thrown LSTM at sequence problems.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Comments: It may be interesting to compare with sparse feed-forward neural networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Summary of the paper:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,The paper introduces sketches that approximates linear and sparse polynomials on binary data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,The paper shows that such sketches can be represented as a one layer neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Experiments are conducted on some language processing tasks.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"Approximation for linear functions and polynomial have been studied in previous work, hashing here is learned as a neural network which is novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Although I have some reserves on the connexion between the theory presented and the learning part in the paper (Please see comments below).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"The main concern is that the  single layer neural network that is  learned  is not restricted to the class of  hash functions studied, hence it is hard to know if we are really testing the hashing class or just a one layer neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Clarity:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,The paper is  written in a clear way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,Comments :,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,The link between neural network and the hashing stems from the implementation of the 'and operation' with a relu and a binary weight V and a bias 1-t. V encodes the support of the linear weight for instance in the linear model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"When Learning V it is regularized with l_1 norm to encourage sparsity, nevertheless the weights are not restricted to be positive to be faithful to the theory introduced in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"When learning V by back propagation when can try projected gradient to restrict V values to be in [0,1].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,On a synthetic example where the support of w is known it would be interesting to see if V recovers the support of w.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"Similarly  for polynomial seems group sparsity is a good regularizer, difficulty being here that the groups are unknown.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,The experiments are limited to small sets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"Sketching is a powerful tool that has found application in a number of classical machine learning methods like least squares, kernel learning and tensor methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"It is very exciting that such application can be extended to deep neural networks, which represent the state-of-the-art for numerous learning tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"However, I have doubts on some aspects of the experimental and analytical settings adopted in this paper, which (in my opinion) might limit its impact in both theoretical understanding and practical applicability.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"1. On the theoretical side, I found the sparse linear/polynomial classifiers assumption very troublesome. If the classifier that one wishes to learn is indeed sparse linear or sparse polynomial, why should neural networks be a good option compared to, say, Lasso or sparse logistic regression models, which are theoretically sound and even optimal for the particular function class to be learnt?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"I think a more relevant setting is where one wants to learn a feedforward neural network, with perhaps sparse weights on each of its layers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"It is an interesting question of whether dimensionality reduction preserves the richness of such sparse weight networks, and how aggressively one can reduce the dimension into (i.e., t in the paper), which leads to much smaller parameter space.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"Also, from a learning theoretical perspective, the existence of a small neural network that approximates a sparse linear/polynomial classifier does not mean such a network can be effectively learnt.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,It would be good that some VC dimension /generalization aspects are analyzed as well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"For example, intuitively network that operates on sketched inputs should have smaller model complexity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"Does it lead to improved generalization, and how such improvement should be traded off for the richness of the network (which desires *larger* sketch length)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1br_2Kge,"2. On the practical side, it seems the most relevant application would be in NLP where inputs are naturally sparse high-dimensional vectors. Reducing the input dimension indeed reduces the size of the model and at least save storage cost. However, in practice the high dimensionality is typically dealt with using a LookupTable structure (encoding), which is not difficult to train at all, because the gradient for each data point only involves one entry in the LookupTable. I think the experiments should include comparison with such traditional approaches and comment on both accuracy and training/testing time. Also, if the argument is that the vocabulary size is so large that LookupTable cannot be stored in GPU memory, such an example should be demonstrated and show how sketching helps.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,There seems to be no experiments demonstrate such advantage (possibly due to the lose initialization of BatchNorm).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,This is the major drawback of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,6),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"The method proposed by the author can in principle do quite complicated transformation, e.g. transform  an entire resnet from a single conv layer, the experiment only consists of simple module transformations, which in some way can be covered by atomic operations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,It would be more interesting to see what the results of more complicated transformations are (even if they are not as effective).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"In summary, this paper studies a novel problem of knowledge transfer in a macroscopic level.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The method could be of interest to the ICLR community.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The experiments should be improved (comment 5) to make the results more convincing and practically useful and I strongly encourage the authors to do so.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,This paper presents works on neural network / CNN architecture morphing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,Results are not reported on ImageNet larger ResNet and new network architecture such as Xception and DenseNet - which are maybe too new!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"Also most results are reported in small datasets and network, which do not offer confidence in the usability in production systems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,My biggest issue is that computational time and effort for these techniques is not mentioned in detail.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"We always want to be able to quantify the extra effort of understanding and using a new technique, especially if the results are minor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The paper proposes a methodology for morphing a trained network to different architecture without having to retrain from scratch.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The manuscript reads well and the description is easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"However, the results are not very convincing as the selected baselines are considerably far from the state of the art.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"The paper should include comparisons with state of the art, for example wide residual networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"Tables should also report number of parameters for each architecture, this would help fair comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The paper presents an interesting incremental approach for exploring new convolutional network hierarchies in an incremental manner after a baseline network has reached a good recognition performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The experiments are presented for the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks by morphing various ResNet models into better performing models with somewhat more computation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"Although the baselines are less strong than those presented in the literature, the paper claims significant error reduction for both ImageNet and CIFAR-100.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,The main idea of the paper is to rewrite convolutions into multiple convolutions while expanding the number of filters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,It is quite unexpected that this approach yields any improvements over the baseline model at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"However, for some of the basic tenets of network morphing, experimental evidence is not given in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,Here are some fundamental questions raised by the paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,How does the quality of morphed networks compares to those with the same topology trained from scratch?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,How does the incremental training time after morphing relate to that of the network trained from scratch?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,Where is the extra computational cost of the morphed networks come from?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,Why is the quality of the baseline ResNet models lag behind those that are reported in the literature and github?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,(E.g. the github ResNet-101 model is supposed to have 6.1% top-5 recall vs 6.6 reported in the paper),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,More evidence for the first three points would be necessary to evaluate the validity of the claims of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,"The paper is written reasonably well and can be understood quite well, but the missing evidence and weaker baselines make it looks somewhat less convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJRIA3Fgg,I would be inclined to revise up the score if a more experimental evidence were given for the main message of the paper (see the points above).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"While this paper has some decent accuracy numbers, it is hard to argue for acceptance given the following:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,1) motivation based on the incorrect assumption that the Paragraph Vector wouldn't work on unseen data,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,2) Numerous basic formatting and Bibtex citation issues.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,Lack of novelty of yet another standard directed LDA-like bag of words/bigram model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"It feels that this paper is structured around a shortcoming of the original paragraph vectors paper, namely an alleged inability to infer representation for text outside of the training data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,I am reasonably sure that this is not the case.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"Unfortunately on that basis, the premise for the work presented here no longer holds, which renders most of the subsequent discussion void.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"While I recommend this paper be rejected, I encourage the authors to revisit the novel aspects of the idea presented here and see if that can be turned into a different type of paper going forward.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"This work reframes paragraph vectors from a generative point of view and in so doing, motivates the existing method of inferring paragraph vectors as well as applying a L2 regularizer on the paragraph embeddings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,The work also motivates joint learning of a classifier on the paragraph vectors to perform text classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"The paper has numerous citation issues both in formatting within the text and the formatting of the bibliography, e.g. on some occasions including first names, on others not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,I suggest the authors use a software package like BibTex to have a more consistent bibliography.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,There seems to be little novelty in this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,The authors claim that there is no proposed method for inferring unseen documents for paragraph vectors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,This is untrue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"In the original paragraph vector paper, the authors show that to get a new vector, the rest of the model parameters are held fixed and gradient descent is performed on the new paragraph vector.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,This means the original dataset is not needed when inferring a paragraph vector for new text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,This work seems to be essentially doing the same thing when finding the MAP estimate for a new vector.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,Thus the only contribution from the generative paragraph vector framing is the regularization on the embedding matrix.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"The supervised generative paragraph vector amounts to jointly training a linear classifier on the paragraph vectors, while inference for the paragraph vector is unchanged.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"For the n-gram based approach, the authors should cite Li et al., 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,"In the experiments, table 1 and 2 are badly formatted with .0 being truncated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,The authors also do not state the size of the paragraph vector.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryT9R3Yxe,Finally the SGPV results are actually worse than that reported in the original paragraph vector paper where SST-1 got 48.7 and SST-2 got 86.3.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The method in this paper introduces a binary encoding level in the PV-DBOW and PV-DM document embedding methods (from Le & Mikolov'14).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The binary encoding consists in a sigmoid with trained parameters that is inserted after the standard training stage of the embedding.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"For a document to encode, the binary vector is obtained by forcing the sigmoid to output a binary output for each of the embedding vector components.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The binary vector can then be used for compact storage and fast comparison of documents.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,the binary representation outperforms the Semantic hashing method from Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"the experimental approach sound: they compare on the same experimental setup as Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09, but since in the meantime document representations improved (Le & Mikolov'14), they also combine this new representation with an RBM to show the benefit of their binary PV-DBOW/PV-DM",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,the insertion of the sigmoid to produce binary codes (from Lin & al. '15) in the training process is incremental,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,the explanation is too abstract and difficult to follow for a non-expert (see details below),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,a comparison with efficient indexing methods used in image retrieval is missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"For large-scale indexing of embedding vectors, derivations of the Inverted multi-index are probably more interesting than binary codes.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,This paper presents a method to represent text documents and paragraphs as short binary codes to allow fast similarity search and retrieval by using hashing techniques.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The real-valued paragraph vectors by Le & Mikolov is extended by adding a stochastic binary layer on top of the neural network architecture.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,Two methods for binarizing the final activations are compared: (1) simply adding noise to sigmoid activations to encourage discritization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,(2) binarizing the activations in the forward pass and keeping them real-valued in the backward pass (straight-through estimation).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The paper presents encouraging results by using straight-through estimation on 20 newsgroup and RCV1 text datasets by using 128 and 32 bit binary codes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"On the plus side, the application presented in the paper is interesting and important.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The exposition of the paper is clean and clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"However, the novelty of the approach is limited from a machine learning standpoint.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The literature on binary hashing beyond semantic hashing and Krizhevsky's binary autoencoders in 2011 is not explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"An important baseline is missing where real-valued paragraph vectors are learned first, and then converted to binary codes using off-the-shelf hashing methods (e.g. random projection LSH by Charikar, BRE by Kulis & Darrell, ITQ by Gong & Lazebnik, MLH by Norouzi & Fleet, etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"Given the lack of novelty and the missing baseline, I do not recommend this paper in its current for publication in the ICLR conference's proceeding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"Moving forward, this paper may be more suitable for NLP conferences as it is more on the applied side.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,More comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,I believe from an practical perspective it may be easier to first learn real-valued paragraph vectors and then quantize them for indexing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"That said, an end-to-end approach as proposed in this paper may perform better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,I would like to see an empirical comparison between the proposed end-to-end approach and a simpler two stage quantization method suggested here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"See ""Estimating or Propagating Gradients Through Stochastic Neurons"" By Bengio et al - discussing straight through estimation and some other alternatives.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The paper argues that the length of binary codes cannot be longer than 32 bits because longer codes are not suitable for document hashing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"This is not quite right given multi-probe hashing mechanisms, for example see ""Mult-index Hashing"" by Norouzi et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"See ""Hashing for Similarity Search: A Survey"" by Wang et al. for a survey of related work on binary hashing and quantization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,You seem to ignore the extensive work done on binary hashing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,This work proposes a model that can learn short binary codes via paragraph vectors to allow fast retrieval of documents.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The experiments show that this is superior to semantic hashing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The approach is simple and not very technically interesting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"For a code size of 128, the loss compared to a continuous paragraph vector seems moderate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,The paper asks the reader to refer to the Salakhutdinov and Hinton paper for the baseline numbers but I think they should be placed in the paper for easy reference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"For simplicity, the paper could show the precision at 12.5%, 25% and 50% recall for the proposed model and semantic hashing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,It also seems that the semantic hashing paper shows results on RCV2 and not RCV1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,RCV1 is twice the size of RCV2 and is English only so it seems that these results are not comparable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,It would be interesting to see how many binary bits are required to match the performance of the continuous representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,A comparison to the continuous PV-DBOW trained with bigrams would also make it a more fair comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,Figure 7 in the paper shows a loss from using the real-binary PV-DBOW.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJhcg6Fxg,"It seems that if a user needed high quality ranking after the retrieval stage and they could afford the extra space and computation, then it would be better for them to use a standard PV-DBOW to obtain the continuous representation at that stage.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,This paper proposes a novel neural network compression technique.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,The goal is to compress maximally the network specification via parameter quantisation with a minimum impact on the expected loss.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"It assumes pruning of the network parameters has already been performed, and only considers the quantisation of the individual scalar parameters of the network.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"the proposed approach takes into account the effect of the weight quantisation on the loss function that is used to train the network, and also takes into account the effect on a variable-length binary encoding of the cluster centers used for the quantisation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"Unfortunately, the submitted paper is 20 pages, rather than the 8 recommended.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The length of the paper seems unjustified to me, since the first three sections (first five pages) are very generic and redundant can be largely compressed or skipped (including figures 1 and 2).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"Although not a strict requirement by the submission guidelines, I would suggest the authors to compress their paper to 8 pages, this will improve the readability of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,To take into account the impact on the network’s loss the authors propose to use a second order approximation of the cost function of the loss.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"In the case of weights that originally constitute a local minimum of the loss, this leads to a formulation of the impact of the weight quantization on the loss in terms of a weighted k-means clustering objective, where the weights are derived from the hessian of the loss function at the original weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The hessian can be computed efficiently using a back-propagation algorithm similar to that used to compute the gradient, as shown in cited work from the literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The authors also propose to alternatively use a second-order moment term used by the Adam optimisation algorithm, since it can be loosely interpreted as an approximate Hessian.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"In section 4.5 the authors argue that with their approach it is more natural to quantise weights across all layers together, due to the hessian weighting which takes into account the variable impact across layers of quantisation errors on the network performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The last statement in this section, however, was not clear to me:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"“In such deep neural networks, quantising network parameters of all layers together is more efficient since optimizing layer-by-layer clustering jointly across all layers requires exponential time complexity with respect to the number of layers.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,Perhaps the authors could elaborate a bit more on this point?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,In section 5 the authors develop methods to take into account the code length of the weight quantisation in the clustering process.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The first method described by the authors (based on previous work), is uniform quantisation of the weight space, which is then further optimised by their hessian-weighted clustering procedure from section 4.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"For the case of nonuniform codeword lengths to encode the cluster indices, the authors develop a modification of the Hessian weighted k-means algorithm in which the code length of each cluster is also taken into account, weighted by a factor lambda.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"Different values of lambda give rise to different compression-accuracy trade-offs, and the authors propose to cluster weights for a variety of lambda values and then pick the most accurate solution obtained, given a certain compression budget.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"In section 6 the authors report a number of experimental results that were obtained with the proposed methods, and compare these results to those obtained by the layer-wise compression technique of Han et al 2015, and to the uncompressed models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"For these experiments the authors used three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with data-set specific architectures taken from the literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,These results suggest a consistent and significant advantage of the proposed method over the work of Han et al.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,Comparison to the work of Gong et al 2014 is not made.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The results illustrate the advantage of the hessian weighted k-means clustering criterion, and the advantages of the variable bitrate cluster encoding.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"In conclusion I would say that this is quite interesting work, although the technical novelty seems limited (but I’m not a quantisation expert).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"Interestingly, the proposed techniques do not seem specific to deep conv nets, but rather generically applicable to quantisation of parameters of any model with an associated cost function for which a locally quadratic approximation can be formulated.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,It would be useful if the authors would discuss this point in their paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,The paper has two main contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,1) Shows that uniform quantization works well with variable length (Huffman) coding,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"2) Improves fixed-length quantization by proposing the Hessian-weighted k-means, as opposed to standardly used vanilla k-means.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The Hessian weighting is well motivated, and it is also explained how to use an efficient approximation ""for free"" when using the Adam optimizer, which is quite neat.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"As opposed to vanilla k-means, one of the main benefits of this approach (apart from improved performance) is that no tuning on per-layer compression rates is required, as this is achieved for free.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"To conclude, I like the paper: (1) is not really novel but it doesn't seem other papers have done this before",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"so it's nice to know it works well, and (2) is quite neat and also works well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"The paper is easy to follow, results are good.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,My only complaint is that it's a bit too long.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8uNptgl,"Minor note - I still don't understand the parts about storing ""additional bits for each binary codeword for layer indication"" when doing layer-by-layer quantization. What's the problem of just having an array of quantized weight values for each layer, i.e. q[0][:] would store all quantized weights for layer 0, q[1][:] for layer 1 etc, and for each layer you would have the codebook. So the only overhead over joint quantization is storing the codebook for each layer, which is insignificant. I don't understand the ""additional bit"" part. But anyway, this is really not a important as I don't think it affects the paper at all, just authors might want to additionally clarify this point (maybe I'm missing something obvious, but if I am then it's likely some other people will as well).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,"However, it is not obvious how much the theoretical properties help us as the model is clearly not fully converged.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,"To me, especially Figure 4 seems to suggest that G(E(x)) might be doing not much more than some kind of nearest neighbour retrival (and indeed one criticism for GANs has always been that they might just memorize some samples).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,"By the way, it would be very interesting to know how well the discriminator actually performs after training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,Coming back to the goal of learning powerful features: The method does not reach state-of-the-art performance on most evaluated tasks (Table 2 and 3) but performs competitive and it would be interesting to see how much this improves if the BiGAN training (and the convolutional architecture used) would be improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,"The paper is very well written and provides most necessary details, although some more details on the training (learning rates, initialization) would be helpful for reproducing the results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,"Overall I think the paper provides a very interesting framework for further research, even though the results presented here are not too impressive both with respect to the feature evaluation (and the GAN learning).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJtNZAFgg,Minor: It might be helpful to highlight the best performance numbers in Tables 2 and 3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The paper proposes an architecture called ReasoNet that reason over the relation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The paper addresses important tasks but there are many other related works.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The comparison to other methods are not comprehensive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The Graph Reachability dataset is not a good example to use.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The paper aims to consolidate some recent literature in simple types of ""reading comprehension"" tasks involving matching questions to answers to be found in a passage, and then to explore the types of structure learned by these models and propose modifications.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,These reading comprehension datasets such as CNN/Daily Mail are on the simpler side because they do not generally involve chains of reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence as can be found in datasets like MCTest.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Many models have been proposed for this task, and the paper breaks down these models into ""aggregation readers"" and ""explicit reference readers.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The authors show that the aggregation readers organize their hidden states into a predicate structure which allows them to mimic the explicit reference readers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The authors then experiment with adding linguistic features, including reference features, to the existing models to improve performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"I appreciate the re-naming and re-writing of the paper to make it more clear that the aggregation readers are specifically learning a predicate structure, as well as the inclusion of results about dimensionality of the symbol space.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Further, I think the effort to organize and categorize several different reading comprehension models into broader classes is useful, as the field has been producing many such models and the landscape is unclear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The concerns with this paper are that the predicate structure demonstrated is fairly simple, and it is not clear that it provides insight towards the development of better models in the future, since the ""explicit reference readers"" need not learn it, and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset has very little headroom left as demonstrated by Chen et al. 2016.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The desire for ""dramatic improvements in performance"" mentioned in the discussion section probably cannot be achieved on these datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,More complex datasets would probably involve multi-hop inference which this paper does not discuss.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Further, the message of the paper is a bit scattered and hard to parse, and could benefit from a bit more focus.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"I think that with the explosion of various competing neural network models for NLP tasks, contributions like this one which attempt to organize and analyze the landscape are valuable, but that this paper might be better suited for an NLP conference or journal such as TACL.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,This paper proposes a new architecture for document comprehension.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The main addition to the model, as claimed by the authors, is that the model is able to adaptively determine how many inference ‘hops’ is required in order to solve a particular problem.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"This is in contrast to previous work, where the number of hops is fixed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Overall, the change of adding a termination gate is rather modest, and it leads to rather small gains on the tested CNN/ Daily Mail dataset (is it possible to include significance here?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Actually, I’m not sure why having an adaptive number of hops would be better performance-wise than using the maximum number of hops – unless I missed it the authors don’t argue this point well (other than saying it mimics humans).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,Does the model forget some things if it performs too many hops?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,The authors do say:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"“The results suggest that the termination gate variable in the ReasoNet is helpful when training with sophisticated examples, and makes models converge faster”",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,but don’t elaborate much beyond this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,I could see for example an argument being made that it reduces the amount of computation required per question.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"The authors do show results comparing the model without a termination gate on the Graph Reachability dataset, and the full model does seem to perform quite a bit better, but I would like this to also be done on the CNN/ Daily Mail datasets, and for there to be more insights into why the performance is improved vs. the ReasoNet-Last model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"One of the contributions I like most from this paper is not the actual model, but the Graph Reachability dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,It is designed to test the reasoning abilities of the ReasoNet model in more detail.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"One of the benefits is that the inference procedure necessary to solve the task is very clear, as opposed to the CNN/ Daily Mail dataset, thus it is easier to see what the model is actually doing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,I would like to see future models also tested on this dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Overall, I think this is a borderline paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,Other remarks:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Note that learning a baseline for REINFORCE has previously been studied, see: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01541v4.pdf (although the authors mention only it briefly in the paper)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,“ReasoNets are devised to mimic the inference process of human readers.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"I think this is too strong a claim (that humans use the same kind of ‘iterative hop’ method for answering questions), unless it is supported by actual analysis of humans – I think the similarities to humans are more at a surface level.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"Also, I think it’s unnecessary to actually understanding the model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"I would change ‘mimic’ to ‘inspired by’, or something along those lines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"EDIT: I thank the authors for taking the time to reply, and clearing some things up with regards to the idea of multiple hops.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,"I am keeping my score the same for the following reason: in my opinion, accepted papers involving new model architectures should either consist of (1) a small adjustment that leads to a large improvement, or (2) a very innovative idea that leads to comparable performance (or better), but provides many new insights about the problem or can be transferred to many different domains.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,This paper seems to be a rather small adjustment (allowing multiple hops) which results in small improvements on CNN/Daily Mail (which as Reviewer 3 points out has little headroom).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlxmAKlg,I think this paper would be suitable for a conference such as EMNLP.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1akgy9xx,For tasks with small training set I can see that stochastic units would help generalize well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,The authors propose a semi-supervised technique for neural networks which includes two objectives: (1) the neural net embeddings of two samples with identical labels is constrained to be closer than the embeddings of samples with different labels (2) the embedding of an unlabeled example is constrained to be close to the embeddings of the closest labeled sample (and far away from the other ones).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,"While the authors list a number of previous works, they do not relate them very well with their approach, and actual differences appear unclear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,"In particular, the approach seems rather incremental with respect to (Hadsell et al. 2006), the way the neighbors are chosen being the main difference; in that respect, (Weston et al, 2008 or 2012) (which could be viewed as an application of DrLim from Hadsell et al, applied to semi-supervised learning) is even closer to the approach proposed here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,"There is also no balancing constraint in the proposed approach, which was known to be crucial in all these models from the 2000s.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,This should be clarified.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,"In summary, the novelty is not clearly defined in this paper; differences with existing literature should be highlighted.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,The intuition is to learn a metric embedding that forms “clusters” with the following desiderata: two labeled examples from the class should have a smaller distance in this embedding compared to any example from another class & a given unlabeled example embedding will be closer to all of the embeddings of *some* label (i.e. that a given unlabeled example will be “matched” to one cluster).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,The paper formulates these intuitions as two differentiable losses and does gradient descent on their sum.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R5Z19le,It’s unclear to me how different is this work from the sum of Hoffer & Ailon (2015) (which is eq. 3) and Grandvalet & Bengio (2004) (seems to be related to eq. 4).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,I’m on the fence about this paper but am leaning towards acceptance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Such detailed empirical explorations are difficult and time-consuming to construct yet can serve as important stepping stones for future work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,I see the length of the paper as a strength since it allows for a very in-depth look into the effectiveness and transferability of different kinds of adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"There are, however, some concerns:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"1) While the length of the paper is a strength in my mind, the key contributions should be made much more clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"As evidenced by my comment earlier, I got confused at some point between the ensemble/non-ensemble method, and about the contribution of the Clarifai evaluation and what I should be focusing on where.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,I’d strongly suggest a radical revision which more clearly focuses the story:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"First, we demonstrate that non-targeted attacks are easy while targeted attacks are hard (evidenced by a key experiment comparing the two; we refer to appendix or later sections for the extensive exploration of e.g., current Section 3)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Thus, we propose an ensemble method that is able to handle targeted attacks much better (evidenced by experiments focusing on the comparison between ensemble and non-ensemble method, both in a controlled setting and on Clarifai)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Also, here are all the other details and explorations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"2) Instead of using ResNet-152, Res-Net-101 and ResNet-50 as three of the five models, it would've been better to use one ResNet architecture and the other two, say, AlexNet and Network-in-Network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,This would make the ensemble results a lot more compelling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"This paper present an experimental study of the robustness of state-of-the-art CNNs to different types of ""attacks"" in the context of image classication.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Specifically, an attack aims to fool the classification system with a specially corrupted image, i.e. making it misclassify the image as (1) any wrong class (non-targeted attack) or (2) a target class, chosen in advance by the attacker (targeted attack).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"For instance, the attacker could corrupt an image of an ostrich in such a way that it would be classified as a megalith.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Even though the attacker's agenda is not so clear in this example, it is still interesting to study the weaknesses of current systems in view of (1) improving them in general and (2) actual risks with e.g. autonomous vehicles.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The paper is mostly experimental.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"In short, it compares different strategies (already published in previous papers) for all popular networks  (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50/101/152) and the two aforementionned types of attacks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The experiments are well conducted and clearly exposed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"A convincing point is that attacks are also conducted on ""clarifai.com"" which is a black-box classification system.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Some analysis and insightful explanations are also provided to help understanding why CNNs are prone to such attacks (Section 6).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"To sum up, the main findings are that non-targeted attacks are easy to perform, even on a black-box system.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Non-targeted attacks are more difficult to realize with existing schemes, but the authors propose a new approach for that that vastly improves over existing attacks (even though it's still far from perfect: ~20% success rate on clarifai.com versus 2% with previous schemes).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"Arguably, The paper still has some weaknesses:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"- The authors are treating the 3 ResNet-based networks as different, yet they are obviously clearly correlated. See Table 7 for instance. This is naturally expected because their architecture is similar (only their depth varies). Hence, it does not sound very fair to state that ""One interesting finding is that [...] the first misclassified label (non-targeted) is the same for all models except VGG-16 and GoogLeNet."", i.e., the three ResNet-based networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"- A subjective measure is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks on the black box system. While this is for a good reason (clarifai.com returns image labels that are different from ImageNet), it is not certain that the reported numbers are fair (even though the qualitative results look convincing).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"- The novelty of the proposed approach (optimizing an ensemble of network instead of a single network) is limited. However, this was not really the point of the paper, and it is effective, so it seems ok overall.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"- The paper is quite long. This is expected because it is an extensive evaluation study, but still. I suggest the authors prune some near-duplicate content (e.g. Section 2.3 has a high overlap with Section 1, etc.).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,- The paper would benefit from additional discussions with the recent and related work of Fawzi et al (NIPS'16) in Section 6. Indeed the work of Fawzi et al. is mostly theoretical and well aligned with the experimental findings and observations (in particular in Section 6).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"To conclude, I think that this paper is somewhat useful for the community and could help to further improve existing architectures, as well as better assess their flaws and weaknesses.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,I reviewed the manuscript as of December 7th.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The authors investigate the transferability of adversarial examples in deep networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The authors confirm that transferability exists even in large models but demonstrate that it is difficult to manipulate the network to adversarially perturb an image into a specifically desired label.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The authors additionally demonstrate real world attacks on a vision web service and explore the geometric properties of adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Major Comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"1. The paper contains a list of many results and it is not clear what single message this paper provides. As mentioned in the comments, this paper is effectively 15 pages and 9 page of results in the Appendix heavily discussed throughout the main body of the paper. Although there is no strict page limit for this conference, I do feel this pushes the spirit of a conference publication. I do not rule out this paper for acceptance based on the length but I do hold it as a negative because clarity of presentation is an important quality. If this paper is ultimately accepted, I would suggest that the authors make some effort to cut down the length even further beyond the 13 pages posted elsewhere. I have marked some sections to highlight areas that may be trimmed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"2. The section of geometric understanding is similar to results of 'Adversarial Perturbations of Deep Neural Networks' in Warde-Farley and Goodfellow (2015). See Figure 1.2. I am not clear what the authors show above-and-beyond these results. If there are additional findings, the authors should emphasize them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"3. The authors expand on observations by Goodfellow et al (2014) and Szegedy et al (2013) demonstrating that large-scale models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations (see also Kurakin et al (2016)). The authors additionally demonstrate that attempting to perform adversarial manipulation to convert an image to a particular, desired label is more difficult.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,4. The authors demonstrate that they can target a real-world vision API. These results are compelling but it is not clear what these results demonstrate above-and-beyond Papernot et al (2016).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,"As far I can understand, I think that the most interesting result from this paper not previously described in the literature is to note about the unique difficulty about performing adversarial manipulation to convert an image to a particular, desired label.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,The rest of the results appear to expand on other results that have already appeared in the literature and the authors need to better explain what these makes these results unique above-and-beyond previous work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Areas to Trim the Paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Table 1 is not necessary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Just cite other results or write the Top-1 numbers in the text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Condense Section 2.2.1 and cite heavily.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sys6GJqxl,Figure 2 panels may be overlaid to highlight a comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"This paper investigates whether the variational inference interpretation of dropout, as introduced in [Gal & Ghahramani (2016), and Kingma et al (2015)], can lead to good estimates of mode uncertainty outside of the training distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,This is an area of research that indeed warrants more experimental investigation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"One very interesting finding is that MC integration leads to much calibration, thus probably much better out-of-sample prediction, than the more usual.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Critique:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"As explained in Kingma et al (2015), when using continuous posterior distributions over the weights, the dropout rate can be optimized, leading to better regularization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"While the paper is cited in the introduction, this adaptive form of dropout is missing from experiments, without clarification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Only the dropout rate p=0.5 was used across experiments, while the optimal rate is problem dependent, as found by earlier published work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"No new ideas are presented, and the analysis in the paper is quite limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"As it stands, this would be more appropriate for a workshop.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the effect of training with noise by dropout or dropconnect, on the predictive uncertainty of neural networks and convnets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,The conclusion seems to be that applying both training and inference with noise can help the network produce better uncertainty estimates in terms of better calibrated predictions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Although the experiments were thorough, the issue with an empirical paper like this is that it is very difficult to ensure that the lessons learned will generalize across problems and domains.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,This paper only investigated two simple image datasets and two neural network architectures on the task of classification.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,There are several ways in which I think this paper could be made stronger.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"First, the problem is not well motivated: why do we care about uncertainty (although I believe we do)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"A good application, or a motivation section would be beneficial here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Next, what about investigating a different domain such as text or speech recognition?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Or other problems such as regression?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Do the results hold across different domains?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Finally, if we really care about uncertainty, there are a number of other techniques for inference in Bayesian neural networks such as stochastic variational inference using the reparameterization trick, or MCMC methods like stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"The advantage of dropout is that it’s simple and fast, but do we lose anything by doing this in terms of calibration?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Other than the empirical comparison, there is little novelty to this paper, and therefore I think the conclusions drawn need to be more general or the motivation more compelling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Even addressing a subset of these suggestions would make the paper stronger in my opinion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,In Figure 4 the calibration MSE does not look so robust when MC sampling is not used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Do you have any hypothesis on why MC sampling is so important here?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"In Figure 5, the legend says “CNN” when it should just be “NN”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Also the caption says convolutional, when it should say fully connected.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"In Table 3, why are the results so poor for non-MC-based dropout?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"Although this agrees with Gal and Ghahramani, this seems to be in direct contradiction to Table 4 of the original JMLR dropout paper by Srivastava et al from 2014.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,How is the noise in the test set applied for Figures 5-10?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Is it Gaussian noise applied to the pixels?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,The authors study the calibration of neural networks using different variants of dropout and weight noise.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,They find that sampling during training and testing improves calibration.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Most of the results are not novel and have been discussed previously by Yarin Gal and other authors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,What this paper adds is a more systematic evaluation of multiple different variants of dropout.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,A comparison against bootstrapped uncertainty estimates would be useful,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,Ian Osband had a paper at NIPS investigating exactly this kind of uncertainty representation in neural nets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,"He found that dropout represents the risk of the model, but not really the uncertainty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1JBJ5gl,This difference becomes apparent when e.g. the target of the model is bi-modal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"This paper explores the use of Open Bigrams as a target representation of words, for application to handwriting image recognition.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,The use of OBs is novel and interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Clearly written and explained.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"No comparison to previous state of the art, only with author-generated results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,More ablation studies needed,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"i.e. fill in Table3 with rnn0,1 rnn0,1,2 rnn0,1' etc etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"It is not clear where the performance is coming from, as it seems that it is single character modelling (0) and word endings (') that are actually beneficial.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"While the use of Open bigrams is novel, there are works which use bag of bigrams and ngrams as models which are not really compared to or explored.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,E.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2227,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,[1] and https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5903 [2].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Both use bag of ngrams models and achieve state of the art results, so it would be interesting to see whether open bigrams in the same experimental setup as [1] would yield better results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Why not use a graph-based decoder like in Fig 2 b?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Overall an interesting paper but the lack of comparisons and benchmarks makes it difficult to assess the reality of the contributions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"This paper uses an LSTM model to predict what it calls ""open bigrams"" (bigrams of characters that may or may not have letters inbetween) from handwriting data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,These open bigrams are subsequently used to predict the written word in a decoding step.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,The experiments indicate that the system does slightly better than a baseline model that uses Viterbi decoding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,I have some major concerns about this paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"I find the ""cortical inspired"" claim troublesome.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"If anything, it is psychology/cognitive science inspired, in the sense that open bigrams appear to help for word recognition (Touzet et al. 2014).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"But the implied cortical characteristics, implicitly referred to e.g. by pointing to analogies between deep neural nets for object recognition and in that case the visual cortex, is unfounded.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Is there any direct evidence from neuroscience that open-bigrams constitute a wholly separate layer in the cortex for a handwriting recognition task?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Dehaene's work is a proposal, so you'll need to describe more ""findings in cognitive neurosciences [sic] research on reading"" (p. 8) to substantiate those claims.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"I am further worried by the fact that the authors seem to think that ""deep neural networks are based on a series of about five pairs of neurons [sic] layers"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Unless I misunderstand something, you are specifically referring to Krizhevsky's AlexNet here (which you should probably have cited there)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,I hope you don't mean to imply that all deep neural nets need five layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"It is also not true that ten is ""quite close to the number of layers of an efficient deep NN""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,what network?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,what task?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,etc.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,The model is not clearly explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,There is a short paragraph in Appendix A.3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"that roughly describes the setup, but this does not include e.g. the objective function, or answer why the network output is only considered each two consecutive time steps, rather than at each time step (or so it seems?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"This is probably because the paper argues that it ""is focused on the decoder"" (p. 6), rather than on the whole problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"I find this problematic, because in that case we're effectively measuring how easy it is to reconstruct a word from its open bigrams, which has very little to do with handwriting recognition (it could have been evaluated on any text corpus).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"In fact, as the example on page 4 shows, handwriting is not necessary to illustrate the open bigram hypothesis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Which leads me to wonder why these particular tasks were chosen, if we are only interested in the decoding mechanism?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,The comparison is not really fair.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"The Viterbi decoder only has access to unigrams, as far as I can tell.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"The only model that does better than that baseline has access to a lot more information, and does not do that much better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Did the Viterbi model have access to the word boundary information (at one point rather confusingly called ""extremities"") that pushed the open bigram model over the edge in terms of performance?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"The dataset also appears to be biased in favor of the proposed approach (longer words, only ).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,I am not convinced that this paper really shows that open bigrams help.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"I very much like the idea of the paper, but I am simply not convinced by its claims.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Minor points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,There are quite a few typos.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Just a sample: ""independant"" (Fig.1), ""we evaluate an handwritten"", "", hand written words [..], an the results"", ""their approach include"", ""the letter bigrams of a word w is"", ""for the two considered database""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Wouldn't it be easy to add how many times a bigram occurs, which would improve the decoding process?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,You can just normalize over the full counts instead of the binary occurrence counts.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"The results in Table 5 are the same (but different precision) as the results in Table 2, except that edit distance and SER are added, this is confusing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,This submission investigates the usability of cortical-inspired distant bigram representations for handwritten word recognition.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Instead of generating neural network based posterior features for character (optionally in local context), sets posterior for character bigrams of different length are used to represent words.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,The aim here is to investigate the viability of this approach and to compare to the standard approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Overall, the submission is well written, although information is missing w.r.t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"to the comparison between the proposed approach and the standard approach, see below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"It would be desirable to see the model complexity of all the different models used here, i.e. the number of parameters used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Language models are not used here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"Since the different models utilize different levels of context, language models can be expected to have a different effect on the different approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,Therefore I suggest to include the use of language models into the evaluation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,For your comparative experiments you use only 70% of the data by choosing longer words only.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkXMikqxx,"On the other hand, it is well known that the shorter words are more prone to result in misrecognitions.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,This paper presents extensions of the KISSME metric learning method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"First, a subspace learning component is integrated, which avoids the need of ad-hoc pre-processing in the case of high-dimensional data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Second, the approach is integrated with a CNN model that derives the features from an input image before it is entered into the Mahalanobis distance computation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The related work section would benefit from a disucssion of previous work that also learns low-rank Mahalanobis metrics, such as e.g. [A].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"One might argue that the referenced work, and similar ones, solves a non-convex objective and is therefore of less interest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"This argument, however, seems weak at the moment that CNN training is integrated, since this also involves hihgly non-convex optimisation, yet leads to excellent results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,A discussion on this point would be useful to include in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"In the first experiment, the authors compare to related metric learning work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"They  conclude that the proposed approach is superior, but this seems unjustified as the CNNs used to generate the features by the authors is different from the one used in related work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Thus it seems to me that no conclusions on the quality of the metric learning approach can be drawn from these experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,In the second experiment the authors show that a baseline where a factorisation of the PSD matrix M is absorbed in the low-rank projection matrix W leads to worse results than the proposed over-parametrised method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,It would be useful if the authors could provide an analysis of why this might be the case; the current text does not seem to provide an explanation or hyposthesis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Is the same cost function used by the proposed method and the pairwise and triplet baseline ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"I found the title of the paper slightly misleading, as the contribution of the paper is not to provide an extension to deep feature training: this has been done extensively in the past.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"In my understanding, the contribution lies in the proposed (overparameterized) formulation of learning a low-rank Mahalanobis metric for the KISSME objective function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Certainly, the extension to deep feature training is interesting, but relatively straightforward as compared to the main contribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,The title could reflect this more accurately.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The main motivation of the paper to base itself on KISSME is scalability, see introduction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"However, for the case where a CNN is trained it seems that it is likely to be in a large-scale data and iterative training regime, and it is not obvious that KISSME would be more efficient than other metric learning objectives based on a pairwise or triplet loss.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Therefore, comparison with other metric learning  objective functions in both performance and run time would be very useful to get a complete picture of which methods are most effective under what conditions.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,KISSME was a promising metric learning approach that got lost in the deep learning flood.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"This is a shame since it had very good results at the time, but it was hindered by the quirks of the PCA pre-processing stage.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"In a nutshell, this paper reimagines this approach using deep convnets, gets good results on modern benchmark datasets and does not require meticulous preprocessing tricks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"It therefore deserves to be published, since it rescues a promising approach from obscurity and does a competent job of illustrating its potential in a modern context, with all the necessary discussion of related work on old (LMNN, MMC, PCCA) and new (deep, triplet-loss based) metric learning approaches.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,The paper modifies the KISSME algorithm in two ways: by incorporating a dimensionality reduction step and by integrating it in a loss function for learning deep networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Experiments show that the latter solution is more stable than standard approaches to metric learning with deep nets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The paper contribution could be good, but the paper could use some polish.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"After carefully reading the authors' response to my original questions, I have to say that I am still confused about several details.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Lemma 1 states that ""log(delta) identifies a Mahalanobis metric ... as M = Proj(...)"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"I still think that the wording of the Lemma is imprecise; the authors should probably simply say that log(delta) results in an approximation of a certain metric, up to a constant term.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The word ""identifies"" definitely does not mean ""approximates"", which, since the word ""approximation"" is contained in the proof of the Lemma, is what is happening here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The authors have promised to fix this issue in the final version by changing the wording to ""log(\delta) determines a Mahalanobis metric"", but ""determines"" means that log(\delta) is a metric, whereas it seems to only *approximate* a metric.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Note also that the proof contains the sentence ""the Mahalanobis distance should approximate"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"It is quite odd to find the verb ""should"" in a mathematical proof.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Ultimately, we are not sure what is being proved since the statement of the lemma is imprecise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Following up on this discussion, about the relationships between Eq. 4 and 6, the authors comment that ""While, the form of Eq.6 may suggest that it is an approximation to Eq.4, as discussed above, it is indeed the form of metric obtained in the latent space"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"I agree that, taken in isolation, this is a valid definition of some metric, but then, at the very least, the paper links this up with the rest of the discussion in a very confusing manner.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Note that Eq. 6 is obtained ""using lemma 1"", which contains the world ""approximation"" in the proof.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"While none of these issues necessarily invalidates the *method* and the *results* of the paper, they make the *premises* a little tenuous and confusing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,A second contribution of the paper is to incorporate KISSME in metric learning using deep networks and pairwise loss.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Here the authors clarify satisfactorily the difference between standard metric learning in deep networks and their approach in their answers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,I would recommend putting the comparison with the baselines upfront to make this message clearer to the reader (e.g. by moving Section 4.2 before Section 4.1).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Eq. (5) and (6) are supposed to ""reflect better"" Eq.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(1) than Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(4).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"In fact, Eq. (6) is a regularised version of Eq.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"(4) (by the low-dimensional bottleneck), so it can only be a worse approximation of Eq.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(1).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Probably the authors mean that the regularisation can make Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(6) preferable to Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(4) on the test data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,I would also like to understand better how the method is integrated in deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"As noted by the authors,  with CNNs one can simply learn a projection matrix L as the last FC layer and define the metric to be L'L. Learning can use the usual Siamese scheme with pairwise or triplet losses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,I am rather confused how the proposed algorithm relates to this approach according (Section 3).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,My understanding is that one first fixes L and trains the rest of the network optimising the pairwise loss Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(14).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Once this is done, one updates L as the square root of the matrix M obtained by the modified KISSME algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Is that correct?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"If so, the authors should compare to the obvious baseline of optimising L directly as part of back-propagation while training the network, as this is a much more direct approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,I am also confused about the dimensionality reduction role of matrix W. In Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,(5) W^T is used to take the data down from dimension D to dimension d.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"However, when applied to a CNN, the dimensionality reduction is assumed to be incorporated in the network itself, such that the dimension of the CNN representation is d from the outset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"Hence, in this case the modified KISSME algorithm does not need to perform any dimensionality reduction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Is that so?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Can the authors give us an intuition of what their algorithm brings on top of standard Siamese learning in this case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Experiments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Comparison with state of the art on the Car dataset is not very meaningful as every method appear to use a different underlying deep net.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"The paper uses GoogLeNet, which is significantly better than VGG-M used by Liu et al (2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Hence it is not surprising that the authors obtain a better performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,I am more interested in understanding the comparison with the KISSME baseline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,How is this baseline applied to this data?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Is there any fine tuning of the CNN at all?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,"If not, this may be enough to explain the difference with the proposed JDR-KISSME.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,There is one last experiment on CIFAR after conclusion and references.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJUdkecgx,Should we consider that as well?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,I have not much to add to my pre-review comments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,It's a very well written paper with an interesting idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,Lots of people currently want to combine RL with NLP.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,It is very en vogue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,Nobody has gotten that to work yet in any really groundbreaking or influential way that results in actually superior performance on any highly relevant or competitive NLP task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,Most people struggle with the fact that NLP requires very efficient methods on very large datasets and RL is super slow.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"Hence, I believe this direction hasn't shown much promise yet",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,and it's not yet clear it ever will due to the slowness of RL.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,But many directions need to be explored and maybe eventually they will reach a point where they become relevant.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"It is interesting to learn the obviously inherent grammatical structure in language though sadly again, the trees here do not yet capture much of what our intuitions are.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"Regardless, it's an interesting exploration, worthy of being discussed at the conference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"The paper proposes to use reinforcement learning to learn how to compose the words in a sentence, i.e. parse tree, that can be helpful for the downstream tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"To do that, the shift-reduce framework is employed and RL is used to learn the policy of the two actions SHIFT and REDUCE.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"The experiments on four datasets (SST, SICK, IMDB, and SNLI) show that the proposed approach outperformed the approach using predefined tree structures (e.g. left-to-right, right-to-left).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,The paper is well written and has two good points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"Firstly, the idea of using RL to learn parse trees using downstream tasks is very interesting and novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,And employing the shift-reduce framework is a very smart choice because the set of actions is minimal (shift and reduce).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"Secondly, what shown in the paper somewhat confirms the need of parse trees.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,This is indeed interesting because of the current debate on whether syntax is helpful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,I have the following comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"it seems that the authors weren't aware of some recent work using RL to learn structures for composition, e.g. Andreas et al (2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"because different composition functions (e.g. LSTM, GRU, or classical recursive neural net) have different inductive biases, I was wondering if the tree structures found by the model would be independent from the composition function choice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,"because RNNs in theory are equivalent to Turing machines, I was wondering if restricting the expressiveness of the model (e.g. reducing the dimension) can help the model focus on discovering more helpful tree structures.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skvgqgqxe,I am thus updating my score from 5 to 6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,The authors propose a new model to learn symbolic expression representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,They do a reasonably extensive evaluation with similar approaches and motivate their approach well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"As expressed in the preliminary questions, I think the authors could improve the motivation for their subexpforce loss.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,At the top of page 6 the authors mention that they compare to two-layer MLP w/o residual connections.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,I think having a direct comparison between a model with and w/o the subexpforce loss would be helpful too and should be included (i.e. keep the residual connections and normalization).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"My main concern is the evaluation ""score"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,It appears to be precision on a per query basis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"I believe a more standard metric, precision-recall or roc would be more informative.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"In particular the chosen metric is expected to perform better when the equivalence classes are larger, since this isn't taken into account in the denominator, but the likelihood of a random expression matching the query increases.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"Contrary to Socher et al. (2012), this paper proposes to use more than one layer (this is especially important to capture XOR operation, which is not surprising at all).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"The paper also introduces a reconstruction error (called SubexpForce), so that the expression of children can be recovered from the expression of the parent (if I understood correctly).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"The model is trained using a classification loss, where the label of a given expression corresponds to its equivalence class.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,- using a classification loss over equivalence classes (should be compared with using similarity).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"- not convinced by the setting: I do not believe that you can really do better than the truth table for boolean expr (or computing the value of the polynomial expression for randomly chosen points in [0, 1]^n).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"- some part of the paper are a bit hard to follow (e.g. justification of the SubexpForce, discussion of why softmax does not work, etc...).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"To train the model parameters, the authors create a dataset of expressions where semantic equivalence relationships are known and minimize a loss function so that equivalent expressions are closer to each other than non-equivalent expressions via a max-margin loss function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"The authors also use a “subexpression forcing” mechanism which, if I understand it correctly, encourages the embeddings to respect some kind of compositionality.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,Results are shown on a few symbolic expression datasets created by the authors and the proposed method is demonstrated to outperform baselines pretty convincingly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,I especially like the PCA visualization where the action of negating an expression is shown to correspond roughly to negating the embedding in its vector space — it is a lot like the man - woman + queen = king type embeddings that we see in the word2vec and glove style papers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"The weakest part of the paper is probably that the setting seems somewhat contrived — I can’t really think of a real setting where it is easy to have a training set of known semantic equivalences, but still more worth it to use a neural network to do predictions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"The authors have also punted on dealing with variable names, assuming that distinct variables refer to different entities in the domain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"This is understandable, as variable names add a whole new layer of complexity on an already difficult problem, but also seems high limiting.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"They say that expressions are simplified into a canonical form and grouped, but this seems to not be possible in general, so one question is — is it possible that equivalent expressions in the training data would have been mapped to different canonical forms?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,* The “COMBINE” operation uses what the authors describe as a residual-like connection.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1vRTeqxg,"Looking at the equations, the reason why this is not actually a residual connection is because of the weight matrix that is multiplied by the lower level l_0 features.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,Perhaps this would provide some guidelines for designing sets of transformations for more complicated scenarios.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,The authors should tone down their claims such as “Our method is an improvement over previous work  <...>,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,"1. the proposed method is more model driven that previous GAN models. But does it pay off? how would a traditional GAN approach perform? The mentioned effects like blur, lighting and background could also potentially be modelled by upsamling network that directly predicts the image. I would assume that blur and lighting can be modelled by convolutions. transformations to some extend by convolutions - or spatial transformer networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,The answers of the authors only partially addresses the point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,The key proposal of the submission seems parameterised modules that can be trained to match the real data distribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,but it remains unclear why not a more generic parameterisation can also do the job.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,E.g. a neural network - as done in regular GANs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,The benefit of introducing a stronger model is unclear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,Using a render engine to generate the initial sample appearance if of limited novelty.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkGakb9lx,"2. how does it compare to traditional data augmentation techniques, e.g. noise, dropout, transformations. you are linking to keras code - where data augmentation is readily available and could be tested (ImageDataGenerator)",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"While this work seems well on its way to that goal, it doesn't quite get there - it leaves a lot of dots still to be connected.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,Also there are a number of things that aren't clear in the paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,o The central idea of the paper it seems is the use of a transformational sparse coding tree to make tractable the inference of the Lie group parameters x_k.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,But how exactly this is done is not at all clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"For example, the sentence: ""The main idea is to gradually marginalize over an increasing range of transformations,"" is suggestive but not clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,This needs to be much better defined.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,What do you mean by marginalization in this context?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,o,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,The connection between the Lie group operator and the tree leaves and weights w_b is not at all clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"The learning rule spells out the gradient for the Lie group operator, but how this is used to learn the leaves of the tree is not clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,A lot is left to the imagination here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"This is especially confusing because although the Lie group operator is introduced earlier, it is then stated that its not tractable for inference because there are too many local minima, and this motivates the tree approach instead.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,So its not clear why you are learning the Lie group operator.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"o It is stated that ""Averaging over many data points, smoothens the surface of the error function.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,I don't understand why you would average over many data points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"It seems each would have its own transformation, no?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,o What data do you train on?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,How is it generated?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,Do you generate patches with known transformations and then show that you can recover them?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,Please explain.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"The results shown in Figure 4 look very interesting, but given the lack of clarity in the above, difficult to interpret and understand what this means, and its significance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"I would encourage the authors to rewrite the paper more clearly and also to put more work into further developing these ideas, which seem very promising.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,A new sparse coding model is introduced that learns features jointly with their transformations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"It is found that inference over per-image transformation variables is hard, so the authors suggest tying these variables across all data points, turning them into global parameters, and using multiple transformations for each feature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"Furthermore, it is suggested to use a tree of transformations, where each path down the tree generates a feature by multiplying the root feature by the transformations associated with the edges.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"The authors claim that the model extracts pose information, but although the model explicitly captures the transformation that relates different features in a tree, at test time, inference is only performed over the (sparse) coefficient associated with each (feature, transformation) combination, just like in sparse coding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"It is not clear what we gain by knowing that each coefficient is associated with a transformation, especially since there are many models that do this general “what / where” split.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,It would be good to check that the x_{v->b} actually change significantly from their initialization values.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rky3QW9le,"Does the proposed model work better according to some measure, compared to a model where x_{v->b} are fixed and chosen from some reasonable range of parameter values (either randomly or spaced evenly)?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,In page 1 the paper points the reader to a review article.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,It could be a good idea to include also more recent references.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,Given the motivation presented in the abstract of the paper it would be a good idea to also comment of works discussing the classes of Boolean functions representable by linear threshold networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,For instance the paper,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,[Hyperplane Arrangements Separating Arbitrary Vertex Classes in n-Cubes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Wenzel, Ay, Paseman] discusses various classes of functions that can be represented by shallow linear threshold networks and provides upper and lower bounds on the number of hidden units needed for representing various types of Boolean functions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,In particular that paper also provides lower bounds on the number of hidden units needed to define a universal approximator.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,It certainly would be a good idea to discuss the results on the learning complexity in terms of measures such as the VC-dimension.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,Thank you for the explanations regarding the constants.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"So if the noise sensitivity is kept constant, larger values of epsilon are associated with a smaller value of delta and of 1/epsilon.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Nonetheless, the description in Theorem 2 is in terms of poly(1/epsilon, 1/delta), which still could increase?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Also, in Lemma 1 reducing the sensitivity at a constant noise increases the bound on k?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The fact that the descriptions are independent of n seems to be related to the definition of the noise sensitivity as an expectation over all inputs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,This certainly deserves more discussion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,One good start could be to discuss examples of functions with an upper bound on the noise sensitivity (aside from the linear threshold functions discussed in Lemma 2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Also, reverse statements to Lemma 1 would be interesting, describing the noise sensitivity of juntas specifically, even if only as simple examples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,On page 3 ``...variables is polynomial in the noise-sensitivity parameters'' should be inverse of?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,MINOR COMMENTS,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,On page 5 Proposition 1 should be Lemma 1?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"This work finds a connection between Bourgain's junta problem, the existing results in circuit complexity, and the approximation of a boolean function using two-layer neural net.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,I think that finding connections between different fields and applying the insights gained is a valid contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"For this reason, I recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"But my current major concern is that this work is only constrained to the domain of boolean hypercube, which is far from what is done in practice (continuous domain).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Indeed, the authors could argue that understanding the former is a first step, but if the connection is only suitable for this case and not adaptable to more general scenarios, then it probably would have limited interest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The approximation capabilities of neural networks have been studied before for approximating different classes of functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The goal of this paper is to provide an analog of the approximation theorem for the class of noise-stable functions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The class of functions that are noise-stable and their output does not significantly depend on an individual input seems an interesting class and therefore I find the problem definition interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The paper is well-written and it is easy to follow the proofs and arguments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,I have two major comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"1- Presentation: The way I understand this arguments is that the noise-stability measures the ""true"" dimensionality of the data based on the dependence of the function on different dimensions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"Therefore, it is possible to restate and prove an analog to the approximation theorems based on ""true"" dimensionality of data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,It is also unclear when the stability based bounds are tighter than dimension based bounds as both of them grow exponentially.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"I find these discussions interesting but unfortunately, the authors present the result as some bound that does not depend on the dimension and a constant (!??)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,that grows exponentially with (1/eps).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,This is not entirely the right picture because the epsilon in the stability could itself depend on the dimension.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,I believe in most problems (1/epsilon) grows with the dimension.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,"2- Contribution: Even though the connection is new and interesting, the contribution of the paper is not significant enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,The presented results are direct applications of previous works and most of the lemmas in the paper are restating the known results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyZprb5xg,I believe more discussions and results need to be added to make this a complete work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"**Edit: Based on the discussion below, my main problem (#2) was not correct.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,I have changed my overall rating from a 3 to a 7**,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"This paper makes a fascinating observation: one can introduce an action-dependent baseline (control variate) into REINFORCE, which introduces bias, and then include a correction term to remove the bias.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"The variance of the correction term is low relative to the REINFORCE update and the action-dependent baseline, and so this results in benefits.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"However, the paper is poorly executed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Below I list my concerns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"1. The paper tries to distinguish between ""policy gradient"" methods and ""actor critic"" methods by defining them in a non-standard way. Specifically, when this paper says ""policy gradient"" it means REINFORCE. Historically, the two have meant different things: some policy gradient algorithms are actor-critics (e.g., Degris et al's INAC algorithm) while others are not (e.g. REINFORCE).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"2. The proposed Q-Prop algorithm includes many interesting design choices that make in unclear what the real source of improved performance is. Is the improved performance due to the use of the action-dependent control variate? Would the same setup but using a state-value baseline still perform just as well? Are the performance benefits due to the use of an off-policy advantage estimation algorithm, GAE(lambda)? Or, would performance have been similar with an on-policy advantage estimation algorithm? What about if a different off-policy advantage estimation algorithm was used, like Retrace(lambda), GTD2, ETD, or WIS-LSTD? Or, is the improved performance due to the use of a replay buffer?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Comparisons are not performed between variants of Q-Prop that show the importances of these different components.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Rather the authors opt to show better performance on a benchmark task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"I find this to be non-scientific, and more of a paper showing a feat of engineering (by combining many different ideas) than it is a research paper that studies the details of which parts of Q-Prop make it work well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"For example, after reading this paper, it is not clear whether having the action-dependent baseline (or using the first order Taylor approximation for the baseline) is beneficial or not - it could be that the strong performance comes from GAE(lambda) or the use of a replay buffer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"At the very least I would have expected comparisons to Q-Prop using a state-value baseline (which would then be a variant of REINFORCE using off-policy data and a replay buffer, and which would show whether the action-dependent baseline is important).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"3. There is a fair amount of discussion about unbiased policy gradient algorithms, which is not accurate. Most policy gradient algorithms are biased, and making them unbiased tends to hurt performance. This is discussed in the paper ""Bias in Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms"", which applies to non-natural algorithms as well. Also, I suspect that the use of GAE(lambda) results in the exact sort of bias discussed in that paper, even when lambda=1. As a result, Q-Prop may act more like an average reward method than expected. This should be discussed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"4. The proposed algorithm can be applied to deep architectures, just as most linear-time policy gradient algorithms can. However, it does not have to be applied to deep architectures. The emphasis on ""deep"" therefore seems to detract from the core ideas of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"5. The paper repeatedly says that importance sampling based methods result in high variance. This ignores weighted importance sampling methods that have very low variance. A good example of this is Mahmood et al's WIS-LSTD algorithm. WIS-LSTD has high computational complexity, so it would only be compared to on non-deep RL problems, of which there are plenty. Alternatively, algorithms like Retrace(lambda) have quite low variance since the likelihood ratios are never bigger than one. Others might argue that ETD algorithms are currently the most effective. The simple dismissal of these algorithms because the original importance sampling estimator proposed in 2000 has high variance is not sufficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"6. The paper does not compare to natural actor-critic algorithms. Once the weights, w, have been computed, REINFORCE uses samples of states from the normalized discounted state distribution and samples of the corresponding returns to estimate the policy gradient. One of the main reasons Q-Prop should work better than REINFORCE is that it includes a control variate that reduces the variance of the policy gradient update after w has been computed. Now, compare this to natural policy gradient algorithms. Once the weights, w, have been computed (admittedly, using compatible features for the advantage estimation but any features for the state-value estimation) the resulting update is = w. That is, is has zero variance and does not require additional sampling. It is as though a perfect control variate was used. Furthermore, natural gradient algorithms can be applied to deep architectures. Degris et al's INAC algorithm is linear time. Desjardin et al's ""natural neural networks"" paper also discusses efficient implementations of natural gradients for neural networks. Dabney's Natural Temporal Difference algorithms have linear time variants that fit this paper's description of actor-critic algorithms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"To summarize, given the weights w, REINFORCE has high variance, and Q-Prop claims to reduce the variance of REINFORCE.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"However, natural policy gradient methods have zero variance given the weights w.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"So, what is the benefit of Q-Prop over natural gradient algorithms using off-policy value function estimation methods to estimate Q (or A)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"That is, why should we expect Q-Prop to perform better than NAC-LSTD using GAE(lambda) with experience replay in place of LSTD?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"7. Equation (2) is false. The right side is proportional to the left side, not equal to it. There is a (1-gamma) term missing. There are also other typos throughout (e.g., Q and A sometimes are missing their action arguments).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Although I have listed my concerns, I would like to re-iterate that I do find the idea of an action-dependent baseline fascinating.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"My problem with this paper is with its execution, not with the novelty, impact, or quality of the core idea.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The paper proposes using a first-order Taylor expansion as a control variate in policy gradient-style methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Empirical results in dynamical control tasks suggest that this algorithm reduces the sample complexity, while the theoretical results presented suggest the algorithm is unbiased but of lower variance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The use of control variates is very important and the present paper is an interesting approach in this direction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"I am not fully convinced of the approach, because it is one of many possible, and the theoretical analysis relies on an approximation of the variance rather than exact calculations, which makes it less compelling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"However, this paper is a step in the right direction so it is worth accepting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"In the experiments, a few things need to be discussed further:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,What is the running time of the proposed approach?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The computation of the extra terms required looks like it could be expensive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,running time comparison in addition to sample comparison should be included,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"The sensitivity to parameter settings of the proposed algorithm needs to be illustrated in separate graphs, since this is one of the main claims in the paper",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,It would be nice to have a toy example included in which one can actually compute exact values and plot learning curves to compare more directly bias and variance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"It would especially be nice to do this with a task that includes rare states, which is the case in which variance of other methods (eg importance sampling) really becomes significant.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,This paper presents  a model-free policy gradient approach for reinforcement learning that combines on-policy updates with an off-policy critic.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The hope is to learn continuous control in a sample-efficient fashion.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The approach is validated on a number of low-dimensional continuous control tasks in a simulated environment.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"The paper is very well written, easy to follow, and provides an adequate context with which to appreciate the contributions it brings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Although this reviewer is not an expert in this literature, the proposed approach appears novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"The Q-Prop estimator appears to be a general and useful method for policy learning, and the experimental validations provide adequate support for the claims of improved sample efficiency.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The detailed derivations given in the Supplementary Materials are very useful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,I like the paper and I don’t have much to comment on.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Perhaps a discussion of the following aspects would add to the depth:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"1) comparison of the methods at a given computational cost, instead of by the number of episodes seen.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,2) discussion of the limitations of the technique: are there situations where convergence is difficult,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Possible typo: in equation (4), should we read  instead of  ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"If not, then what is Q() without subscript w?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,This paper proposed a new policy gradient method that uses the Taylor expansion of a critic as the control variate to reduce the variance in gradient estimation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The key idea is that the critic can be learned in an off-policy manner so that it is more sample efficient.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Although the algorithm structure is similar to actor-critic, the critic information is “truncated” in a proper manner to reduce the variance in policy gradient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The proposed methods are evaluated on OpenAI Gym’s MuJoCo domains.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Q-Prop is shown to produce more stable performance compared to DDPG and has higher sample efficiency than TRPO.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The stability of off-policy TD learning for the critic is not guaranteed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Do the authors observe instability of it in the experiment?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"As the authors stated in the paper, the critic does not need to approximate the actual value function very well as long as it is correlated with \hat{A}.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"In the two adaptive Q-Prop schemes, the authors apply some tricks (conservative and aggressive adaptation) to control the possible unreliable estimate of the critic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,This could be another evidence that the off-policy critic is not reliable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The authors may need to comment more on this point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"Especially, it will be useful if the authors could show/justify that by such a design Q-Prop is robust against unreliable critic estimate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,The authors seem to indicate that the advantage of Q-Prop over DDPG is in its insensitivity to hyperparameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"In Figure 3(a), the authors show that DDPG is sensitive to hyperparameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"However, the sensitivity of Q-Prop to the same hyperparameter is not shown.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Experiments in the paper show that Q-Prop has advantage over TRPO in sample complexity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"However, not much experiments are shown to justify the advantage of Q-Prop over DDPG.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,"This is important because Table 1 shows that TR-c-Q-Prop needs significantly more samples than DDPG on Hopper, HalfCheetah and Swimmer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ3rcZcxl,Any comment on that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,A method for click prediction is presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Inputs are a categorical variables and output is the click-through-rate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The categorical input data is embedded into a feature vector using a discriminative scheme that tries to predict whether a sample is fake or not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The embedding vector is passed through a series of SUM/MULT gates and K-most important interactions are identified (K-max pooling).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,This process is repeated multiple times (i.e. multiple layers) and the final feature is passed into a fully connected layer to output the click prediction rate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Authors claim:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,(1) Use of gates and K-max pooling allow modeling of interactions that lead to state of art results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,(2) It is not straightforward to apply ideas in papers like word2vec to obtain feature embeddings and consequently they use the idea of discriminating between fake and true samples for feature learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Theoretically convolutions can act as “sum” gates between pairs of input dimensions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Authors make these interactions explicit (i.e. imposed structure) by using gates.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Now, the merit of the proposed method can be tested if a network using gates outperforms a network without gates.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,This baseline is critically missing – i.e. Embedding Vector followed by a series of convolution/pooling layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Another related issue is that I am not sure if the number of parameters in the proposed model and the baseline models is similar or not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,For instance – what is the total number of parameters in the CCPM model v/s the proposed model?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Overall, there is no new idea in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,This by itself is not grounds for rejection if the paper outperforms established baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"However, such comparison is weak and I encourage authors to perform these comparisons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The paper proposes a way to learn continuous features for input data which consists of multiple categorical data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"The idea is to embed each category in a learnable low dimensional continuous space, explicitly compute the pair-wise interaction among different categories in a given input sample (which is achieved by either taking a component-wise dot product or component-wise addition), perform k-max pooling to select a subset of the most informative interactions, and repeat the process some number of times, until you get the final feature vector of the given input.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,This feature vector is then used as input to a classifier/regressor to accomplish the final task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The embeddings of the categories are learnt in the usual way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"In the experiment section, the authors show on a synthetic dataset that their procedure is indeed able to select the relevant interactions in the data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,On one real world dataset (iPinYou) the model seems to outperform a couple of simple baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,My major concern with this paper is that their's nothing new in it.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"The idea of embedding the categorical data having mixed categories has already been handled in the past literature, where essentially one learns a separate lookup table for each class of categories: an input is represented by concatenation of the embeddings from these lookup table, and a non-linear function (a deep network) is plugged on top to get the features of the input.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The only rather marginal contribution is the explicit modeling of the interactions among categories in equations 2/3/4/5.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Other than that there's nothing else in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Not only that, I feel that these interactions can (and should) automatically be learned by plugging in a deep convolutional network on top of the embeddings of the input.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,So I'm not sure how useful the contribution is.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,The experimental section is rather weak.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,They authors test their method on a single real world data set against a couple of rather weak baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"I would have much preferred for them to evaluate against numerous models proposed in the literature which handle similar problems, including wsabie.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"While the authors argued in their response that wsabie was not suited for their problem, i strongly disagree with that claim.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"While the original wsabie paper showed experiments using images as inputs, their training methodology can easily be extended to other types of data sets, including categorical data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"For instance, I conjecture that the model i proposed above (embed all the categorical inputs, concatenate the embeddings, plug a deep conv-net on top and train using some margin loss) will perform as well if not better than the hand coded interaction model proposed in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Of course I could be wrong, but it would be far more convincing if their model was tested against such baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"In this paper, the author proposed an approach for feature combination of two embeddings v1 and v2.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"This is done by first computing the pairwise combinations of the elements of v1 and v2 (with complicated nonlinearity), and then pick the K-Max as the output vector.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"For triple (or higher-order) combinations, two (or more) consecutive pairwise combinations are performed to yield the final representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"It seems that the approach is not directly related to categorical data, and can be applied to any embeddings (even if they are not one-hot).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,So is there any motivation that brings about this particular approach?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,What is the connection?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,There are many papers with similar ideas.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"CCPM (A convolutional click prediction model) that the authors have compared against, also proposes very similar network structure (conv + K-max + conv + K-max).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"In the paper, the author does not mention their conceptual similarity and difference versus CCPM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Compact Bilinear Pooling, https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06062 has been proposed a year ago and yields state-of-the-art performances in Visual Question Answering https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01847.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,So the author might need to compare against those methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"I understand that the proposed approach incorporates more nonlinear operations (rather than bilinear) in pairwise combination, but it is not clear whether bilinear operations is sufficient to achieve the same level of performance, and whether complicated operations (e.g., Eqn. 4) are needed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"In the experiment, the performance seems to be not as impressive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"There is about 1%-2% difference in performance between the proposed approach and baselines (e.g., in Tbl. 2, and Tbl. 3).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,Is that a big deal for click-rate prediction?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"When comparing among LR, FFM, CCPM, FNN, and proposed approach, the number of parameters (i.e., model capacity) are not shown.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,This could be unfair since the proposed model could have more parameters (note that the authors seems to misunderstand the questions).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyNxRZ9xg,"Besides, claiming that previous approaches does not learn representations seems to be a bit restrictive, since typical deep models learn the representation implicitly (e.g., CCPM and FNN listed in the paper as baselines).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,This paper proposes a new idea to help defending adversarial examples by training a complementary classifier to detect them.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The results of the paper show that adversarial examples in fact can be easily detected.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Moreover, such detector generalizes well to other similar or weaker adversarial examples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The idea of this paper is simple but non-trivial.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"While no final scheme is proposed in the paper how this idea can help in building defensive systems, it actually provides a potential new direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Based on its novelty, I suggest an acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,My main concern of this paper is about its completeness.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,No effective method is reported in the paper to defend the dynamic adversaries.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"It could be difficult to do so, but rather the paper doesn’t seem to put much effort to investigate this part.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,How difficult it is to defend the dynamic adversaries is an important and interesting question following the conclusions of this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Such investigation may essentially help improve our understanding of adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"That being said, the novelty of this paper is still significant.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Minor comment:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The paper needs to improve its clarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Some important details are skipped in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"For example, the paper should provide more details about the dynamic adversaries and the dynamic adversary training method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,This paper explores an important angle to adversarial examples: the detection of adversarial images and their utilization for trainig more robust networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,This takes the competition between adversaries and models to a new level.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The paper presents appealing evidence for the feasibility of robustifying networks by employing the a detector subnetwork that is trained particularly for the purpose of detecting the adversaries in a terget manner rather than just making the networks themselves robust to adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The jointly trained primary/detector system is evaluated in various scenarios including the cases when the adversary generator has access to the model and those where they are generated in a generic way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The results of the paper show good improvements with the approach and present well motived thorough analyses to back the main message.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The writing is clear and concise.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,I reviewed the manuscript on December 5th.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The authors investigate the phenomenon of adversarial perturbations and ask whether one may build a system to independently detect an adversarial data point,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"if one could detect an adversarial example, then might prevent a machine from automatically processing it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Major comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,The authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might intervene in those cases.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,A potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,My second comment is about 'model transferability'.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,(The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,and not specific to a given trained model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Different methods have different levels of 'model transferability' (Kurakin et al, 2016) and I am concerned how well the detector they built would be able to detect adversarial examples across *all models* and not just the trained model in question.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"In other words, a good detector would be able to detect adversarial examples from any network and not just one particularly trained network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,This question seems largely unaddressed in this paper but perhaps I missed some subtle point in their descriptions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"If there were any points in the bottom-left of the Figure 2 left, then this would be very important to see",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,perhaps move the legend to highlight if the area contains no points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,X-axis label is wrong in Figure 2 right.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,Measure the transferability of the detector?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,How is \sigma labeled on Figure 5?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"Whenever an image is constructed to be an 'adversary', has the image actually been tested to see if it is adversarial?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzCSf9xg,"In other words, does the adversarial image actually result in a misclassification by the original network?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,The paper presents an alternative way of supervising the training of neural network without explicitly using labels when only link/not-link information is available between pairs of examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,A pair of network is trained each of which is used to supervise the other one.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"The presentation of the paper is not very clear, the writing can be improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Some design choice are not explained: Why is the power function used in the E-step for approximating the distribution (section 2.1)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Why do the authors only consider a uniform distribution?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,I understand that using a different prior breaks the assumption that nothing is known about the classes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,However I do not see a practical situations where the proposed setting/work would be useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Also, there exist a large body of work in semi-supervised learning with co-training based on a similar idea.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Overall, I think this work should be clarified and improved to be a good fit for this venue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"The paper explores a new technique for classless association, a milder unsupervised learning where we do not know the class labels exactly, but we have a prior about the examples that belong to the same class.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Authors proposed a two stream architecture with two neural networks, as streams process examples from the same class simultaneously.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Both streams rely on the target (pseudo classes or cluster indices) of each other, and the outputs an intermediate representation z, which is forced to match with a statistical distribution (uniform in their case).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"The model is trained with EM where the E step obtains the current statistical distribution given output vectors z, and M step updates the weights of the architecture given z and pseudo-classes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Experimental results on re-organized MNIST exhibits better performance compared to classical clustering algorithms (in terms of association accuracy and purity).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"The authors further provide comparison against a supervised method, where proposed architecture expectedly performs worse but with promising results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,The basic motivation of the architecture apparently relies on unlabeled data and agreement of the same pseudo-labels generated by two streams.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"But the paper is hard to follow and the motivation for the proposed architecture itself, is hidden in details.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,What is trying to be achieved by matching distributions and using the pseudo-targets of the each other?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Perhaps the statistical distribution of the classes is assumed to be uniform but how will it extend to other priors, or even the case where we do not assume that we know the prior?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,The current setup needs justifications.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"What would be very interesting is to see two examples having the same class but one from MNIST, the other from Rotated-MNIST or Background-MNIST.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Because it is hard to guess how different the examples in two streams.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"At the end, I feel like the authors have found a very interesting approach for classless association which can be extended to lots of many-to-one problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,This is a good catch.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,I would like to see the idea in the future with some extensive experiments on large scale datasets and tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,But the current version lacks the theoretical motivations and convincing experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,I would definitely recommend this paper to be presented in ICLR workshop.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Few more points:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Typo: Figure1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"second line in the caption ""that"" -> ""than""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Necessity of Equation 2 is not clear,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Batch size M is enormous compared to classical models, there is no explanation for this",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Why uniform? should be clarified (of course it is the simplest prior to pick but just a few words about it would be good for completeness),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,"Typo: Page 6, second paragraph line 3: ""that"" -> ""than""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,The paper looks correct but still i am not convinced about the experimentation performed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Perhaps another experiment with more challenging data would be welcome.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh_8f9lg,Honestly i don't find a clear motivation for this work however it could have some potential and it would be interested to be presented in conference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The multiagent system is proposed as a generalization of neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The proposed system can be used with less restrictive network structures more efficiently by computing only those necessary computations in the graph.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"Unfortunately, I don't find the proposed system different from the framework of artificial neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"Although for today's neural network structures are designed to have a lot of matrix-matrix multiplications, but it is not limited to have such architecture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"In other words, the proposed multiagent system can be framed in the artificial neural network with more complicated layer/connectivity structures while considering each neuron as layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The computation efficiency is argued among different sparsely connected denoising autoencoder in multiagent system framework only but the baseline comparison should be against the fully-connected neural network that employs matrix-matrix multiplication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The paper reframes feed forward neural networks as a multi-agent system.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,It seems to start from the wrong premise that multi-layer neural networks were created expressed as full matrix multiplications.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"This ignores the decades-long history of development of artificial neural networks, inspired by biological neurons, which thus started from units with arbitrarily sparse connectivity envisioned as computing in parallel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The matrix formulation is primarily a notational convenience; note also that when working with sparse matrix operations (or convolutions) zeros are neither stored not multiplied by.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"Besides the change in terminology, essentially renaming neurons agents, I find the paper brings nothing new and interesting to the table.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,Pulling in useful insights from a different communitiy such as multi-agent systems would be most welcome.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"But for this to be compelling, it would have to be largely unheard-of elements in neural net research, with clear supporting empirical evidence that they significantly improve accuracy or efficiency.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,This is not achieved in the present paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"Unfortunately, the paper is not clear enough for me to understand what is being proposed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"At a high-level the authors seem to propose a generalization of the standard layered neural architecture (of which MLPs are a special case), based on arbitrary nodes which communicate via messages.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,The paper then goes on to show that their layer-free architecture can perform the same computation as a standard MLP.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,This logic appears circular.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"The low level details of the method are also confusing: while the authors seem to be wanting to move away from layers based on matrix-vector products, Algorithm 4 nevertheless resorts to matrix-vector products for the forward and backwards pass.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1PA8fqeg,"Although the implementation relies on asynchronously communicating nodes, the “locking” nature of the computation makes the two entirely equivalent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,This paper presents a model for semi-supervised learning by encouraging feature invariance to stochastic perturbations of the network and/or inputs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"Two models are described:  One where an invariance term is applied between different instantiations of the model/input a single training step, and a second where invariance is applied to features for the same input point across training steps via a cumulative exponential averaging of the features.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"These models evaluated using CIFAR-10 and SVHN, finding decent gains of similar amounts in each case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"An additional application is also explored at the end, showing some tolerance to corrupted labels as well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"The authors also discuss recent work by Sajjadi &al that is very similar in spirit, which I think helps corroborate the findings here.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,My largest critique is it would have been nice to see applications on larger datasets as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"CIFAR and SVHN are fairly small test cases, though adequate for demonstration of the idea.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"For cases of unlabelled data especially, it would be good to see tests with on the order of 1M+ data samples, with 1K-10K labeled, as this is a common case when labels are missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"On a similar note, data augmentations are restricted to only translations and (for CIFAR) horizontal flips.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"While ""standard,"" as the paper notes, more augmentations would have been interesting to see",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,particularly since the model is designed explicitly to take advantage of random sampling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"Some more details might also pop up, such as the one the paper mentions about handling horizontal flips in different ways between the two model variants.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"Rather than restrict the system to a particular set of augmentations, I think it would be interesting to push it further, and see how its performance behaves over a larger array of augmentations and (even fewer) numbers of labels.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"Overall, this seems like a simple approach that is getting decent results, though I would have liked to see more and larger experiments to get a better sense for its performance characteristics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"Smaller comment: the paper mentions ""dark knowledge"" a couple times in explaining results, e.g. bottom of p.6.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"This is OK for a motivation, but in analyzing the results I think it may be possible to have something more concrete.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"For instance, the consistency term encourages feature invariance to the stochastic sampling more strongly than would a classification loss alone.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,This work explores taking advantage of the stochasticity of neural network outputs under randomized augmentation and regularization techniques to provide targets for unlabeled data in a semi-supervised setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,This is accomplished by either applying stochastic augmentation and regularization on a single image multiple times per epoch and encouraging the outputs to be similar (Π-model) or by keeping a weighted average of past epoch outputs and penalizing deviations of current network outputs from this running mean (temporal ensembling).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,The core argument is that these approaches produce ensemble predictions which are likely more accurate than the current network and are thus good targets for unlabeled data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Both approaches seem to work quite well on semi-supervised tasks and some results show that they are almost unbelievably robust to label noise.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,The paper is clearly written and provides sufficient details to reproduce these results in addition to providing a public code base.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,The core idea of the paper is quite interesting and seems to result in higher semi-supervised accuracy than prior work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I also found the attention to and discussion of the effect of different choices of data augmentation to be useful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I am a little surprised that a standard supervised network can achieve 30% accuracy on SVHN given 90% random training labels.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,This would only give 19% correctly labeled data (9% by chance + 10% unaltered).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"I suppose the other 81% would not provide a consistent training signal such that it is possible, but it does seem quite unintuitive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I tried to look through the github for this experiment but it does not seem to be included.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"As for the resistance of Π-model and temporal ensembling to this label noise, I find that somewhat more believable given the large weights placed on the consistency constraint for this task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,The authors should really include discussion of w(t) in the main paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Especially because the tremendous difference in w_max in the incorrect label tolerance experiment (10x for Π-model and 100x for temporal ensembling from the standard setting).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Could the authors comment towards the scalability for larger problems?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"For ImageNet, you would need to store around 4.8 gigs for the temporal ensembling method or spend 2x as long training with Π-model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Can the authors discuss sensitivity of this approach to the amount and location of dropout layers in the architecture?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Preliminary rating:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I think this is a very interesting paper with quality results and clear presentation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Minor note:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,2nd paragraph of page one 'without neither' -> 'without either',0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"This paper presents a semi-supervised technique for “self-ensembling” where the model uses a consensus prediction (computed from previous epochs) as a target to regress to, in addition to the usual supervised learning loss.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"This has connections to the “dark knowledge” idea, ladder networks work is shown in this paper to be a promising technique for scenarios with few labeled examples (but not only).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"The paper presents two versions of the idea: one which is computationally expensive (and high variance) in that it needs two passes through the same example at a given step, and a temporal ensembling method that is stabler, cheaper computationally but more memory hungry and requires an extra hyper-parameter.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,My thoughts on this work are mostly positive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"The drawbacks that I see are that the temporal ensembling work requires potentially a lot of memory, and non-trivial infrastructure / book-keeping for imagenet-sized experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I am quite confused by the Figure 2 / Section 3.4 experiments about tolerance to noisy labels: it’s *very* incredible to me that by making 90% of the labels random one can still train a classifier that is either 30% accurate or ~78% accurate (depending on whether or not temporal ensembling was used).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"I don’t see how that can happen, basically.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Minor stuff:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,Please bold the best-in-category results in your tables.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I think it would be nice to talk about the ramp-up of w(t) in the main paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,"The authors should consider putting the state of the art results for the fully-supervised case in their tables, instead of just their own.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,I am confused as to why the authors chose not to use more SVHN examples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ6oOfqge,The stated reason that it’d be “too easy” seems a bit contrived: if they used all examples it would also make it easy to compare to previous work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,This paper makes three main methodological contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,- definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,- ranking of neurons based on color selectivity,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,- ranking of neurons based on class selectivity,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"The main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"However, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"For example, a few are:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"- “Indexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers.” As far as I know, this had not been previously reported.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,- Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"- “our main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011)).” Great observation!",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"Overall, I’d recommend the paper be accepted, because although it’s difficult to predict at this time, there’s a fair chance that one of the “smaller conclusions” would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,Other small comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,- The cite for “Learning to generate chairs…” is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"- What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn’t well defined and it wasn’t previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"- For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of *any* color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it’s somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn’t color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It’s a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"The authors analyze trained neural networks by quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons in the network for a variety of specific features, including color and category.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"(a) From a neuroscience point of view, they could have compared the properties that they measure in models to the same properties as measured in neurons the real brain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"If they could show that some models are better matches on these properties to the actual neural data than others, that would be a really interesting result.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"That is is to say, the two isolated catalogs of selectivities (from model neurons and real neurons)  alone seem pretty pointless.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,But if the correspondence between the two catalogs was made,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"both in terms of where the model neurons and the real neurons were similar, and (especially importantly) where they were different",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,that would be the beginning of nontrivial understanding.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,Such results would also complement a growing body of literature that attempts to link CNNs to visual brain areas.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"Finding good neural data is challenging, but whatever the result, the comparison would be interesting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,and/or,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"(b) From an artificial intelligence point of view, they could have shown that their metrics are *prescriptive* constraints.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"That is, suppose they had shown that the specific color and class selectivity indices that they compute, when imposed as a loss-function criterion on an untrained neural network, cause the network to develop useful filters and achieve significantly above-chance performance on the original task the networks were trained on.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"This would be a really great result, because it would not only give us a priori reason to care about the specific property metrics they chose, but it would also help contribute to efforts to find unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning procedures, since the metrics they compute can be estimated from comparatively small numbers of stimuli and/or high-level semantic labels.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,"To put this in perspective, imagine that they had actually tested the above hypothesis and found it to be false:  that is, that their metrics, when used as loss function constraints, do not improve performance noticeably above chance performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,What would we then make of this whole investigation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJBr9Mcxl,It would then be reasonable to think that the measured properties were essentially epiphenomenal and didn't contribute at all to the power of neural networks in solving perceptual tasks.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJy_5Mcll,My concern is that the most of design choices are pretty ad-hoc and there is a lack of ablation study to validate each choice.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG4hz5le,This paper proposes a video captioning model based on a 3D (space+time) convnet (C3D) encoder and a LSTM decoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG4hz5le,The authors investigate the benefits of using attention mechanisms operating both at the spatio-temporal and layer (feature abstraction) levels.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG4hz5le,4) Conclusion,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG4hz5le,"Although the novelty with existing video captioning approaches is limited, the paper is relevant to ICLR, as the proposed simple but efficient implementation and benefits of spatio-temporal + feature abstraction attention are clearly validated in this work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,This paper proposes a simple randomized algorithm for selecting which weights in a ConvNet to prune in order to reduce theoretical FLOPs when evaluating a deep neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,The paper provides a nice taxonomy or pruning granularity from coarse (layer-wise) to fine (intra-kernel).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,The pruning strategy is empirically driven and uses a validation set to select the best model from N randomly pruned models.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,"Feature map pruning can obviously accelerate computation without specialized sparse implementations of convolution, but this is not the case for finer grained sparsity; since this paper considers fine-grained sparsity it should provide some evidence that introducing that sparsity can yield performance improvements",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,Another experimental downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,"For example, there is not much direct interest in the tasks of MNIST, CIFAR10, or even ImageNet.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkvS3Mqxe,Note that I agree with that a smaller network may be more generalizable than a larger network.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,Cons / points suggested for a rebuttal:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,(1) One claim of the paper given in the abstract is ”experiments on competitive baselines demonstrate that Entropy-SGD leads to improved generalization and has the potential to accelerate training.“,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,This does not appear to be supported by the current set of experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"As the authors comment in the discussion section, “In our experiments, Entropy-SGD results in a comparable generalization error as SGD, but always has a lower cross-entropy loss.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,It's not clear to me how to reconcile those two claims.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"(2) Similarly, the claim of accelerated training is not convincingly supported in the present version of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"Vanilla SGD requires a single forward pass through all M minibatches during one epoch for a parameter update, but the new method, E-SGD requires, L*M forward passes during one epoch where L is the number of Langevin updates, which require a minibatch sample each.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"For example, the introduction reads “Actively biasing towards wide valleys aids generalization, in fact, we can optimize solely the free energy term to obtain similar generalization error as SGD on the original loss function.“",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"According the the values reported on pp.9-10, only on MNIST is the generalization error, using only the free energy term (the log partition function of the modified Gibbs distribution), equivalent to using only the SGD loss function.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,The motivation to seek such minima is due to their better generalization ability.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,I have a couple of concerns that the authors may want to clarify in the rebuttal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"1. When reporting the generalization performance, the experiments report the number of epochs; showing the proposed algorithm reaches better generalization in fewer epochs than plain SGD. Is this the number of epochs it takes by line 7 of your algorithm, or it is the total number of epochs (line 3 and 7 all combined)? If the former, it is not a fair comparison. If you multiply the number of epochs of SGD (line 7) by the number iterations it takes to approximate Langevin dynamics, it seems you obtain little gain against plain SGD.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1YfAfcgl,"2. The proposed algorithm approximates the smoothed ""exponentiated"" loss (by smoothing I refer to convolution with the Gaussian). I am wondering how it compares against simpler idea of smoothing the original loss (dropping exponentiation)? Is the difference only in the motivation (e.g. thermodynamics interpretation) or it is deeper, e.g. the proposed scheme lends itself to more accurate approximation and/or achieves better generalization bound (in terms of the attained smoothness)? Smoothing the cost function without exponentiation allows simpler approximation (Monte Carlo integration instead of MCMC), e.g. see section 5.3 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04114",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,My main problem with this submission is that it is hard as a reviewer to pin down what precisely the novelty is - beyond perhaps articulating these views better than other papers have done in the past.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,summarises my feeling about this paper: this is a nice 'unifying review’ type paper that - for me - lacks a novel insight.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I am open to be convinced either way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I think the authors should probably discuss the connection of Eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,(13) to KLIEP: Kullback-Leibler Importance Estimation by Shugiyama and colleagues.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I don’t quite see how the part with equation (13) and (14) fit into the flow of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,By this point the authors have established the view that GANs are about estimating likelihood ratios - and then using these likelihood ratios to improve the generator.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,These paragraphs read like: we also tried to derive another particular formulation for doing this but we failed to do it in a practical way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,There is a typo in spelling Csiszar divergence,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,Equation (15) is known (to me) as Least Squares Importance Estimation by Kanamori et al (2009).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"A variant of least-squares likelihood estimation uses the kernel trick, and finds a function from an RKHS that best represents the likelihood ratio between the two distributions in a least squares sense.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I think it would be interesting to think about how this function is related to the witness function commonly used in MMD and what the properties of this function are compared to the witness function - perhaps showing the two things for simple distributions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"I have stumbled upon the work of Sugiyama and collaborators on direct density ratio estimation before, and I found that work very insightful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"Generally, while some of this work is cited in this paper, I felt that the authors could do more to highlight the great work of this group, who have made highly significant contributions to density ratio estimation, albeit with a different goal in mind.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"On likelihood ratio estimation: some methods approximate the likelihood ratio directly (such as least-squares importance estimation), some can be thought of more as approximating the log of this quantity (logistic regression, denoising autoencoders).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,An unbiased estimate of the ratio will provide a biased estimate of the logarithm and vice versa.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"To me it feels like estimating the log of the ratio directly is more useful, and in more generality estimating the convex function of the ratio which is used to define the f-divergence seems like a good approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,Could the authors comment on this?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I think the hypothesis testing angle is oversold in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,I’m not sure what additional insight is gained by mixing in some hypothesis testing terminology.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,"Other than using quantities that appear in hypothesis testing as tests statistics, his work does not really talk about hypothesis testing, nor does it use any tools from the hypothesis testing literature.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16Jem9xe,The only reason that I decided to hold back my strong acceptance recommendation is that I don't understand the acceptance criteria of ICLR.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,This parameter is proposed to more effectively counter vanishing gradients.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,My main concern regarding this paper is related to the authors' claims about the effectiveness of PELU.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,The analysis in Sections 2 and 3 discusses how PELU might improve training by combating gradient propagation issues.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"This by itself does not imply that improved generalization will result, only that models may be easier to train.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"However, the experiments all seek to demonstrate improved generalization performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"But this could in principle be due to a better inductive bias, and have nothing to do with the optimization analysis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,None of the experiments are designed to directly support the stated theoretical advantage of PELU compared to ELU in optimizing models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"In the response to the pre-review question, the authors state that the claims in Section 2 and 3.3 are meant to apply to generalization performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"I fail to see how this is true for most claims, except the flexibility claim.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"As the authors agree, better training may or may not lead to better out-of-sample performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"I can only agree that having flexibility can sometimes help the network adapt its inductive bias to the problem (instead of overfitting), but this is a much weaker claim compared to the mathematical justifications for improved optimization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,On selection of learning hyperparameters:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"The authors state in the discussion on OpenReview that the learning rates selected were favorable to ReLU, and not PELU.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"However, this does not guarantee that they were not unfavorable to ELU.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,It raises the question: can a regime be constructed where ELU has better performance than PELU?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"If so, how can we draw the conclusion that PELU is better?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,"Overall, I am not yet convinced by the experimental setup and the match between theory and experiments in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,Authors present a parameterized variant of ELU and show that the proposed function helps to deal with vanishing gradients in deep networks in a way better than existing non-linearities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,They present both a theoretical analysis and practical validation for presented approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,Interesting observations on statistics of the PELU parameters are reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,Perhaps explanation for the observed evolution of parameters can help better understand the non-linearity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkepl7cee,It is hard to evaluate the experimental validation presented given the difference in number of parameters compared to other approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,There is a great deal of ongoing interest in compressing neural network models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"One line of work has focused on using low-precision representations of the model weights, even down to 1 or 2 bits.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"However, so far these approaches have been accompanied by a significant impact on accuracy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"The paper proposes an iterative quantization scheme, in which the network weights are quantized in stages",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"the largest weights (in absolute value) are quantized and fixed, while unquantized weights can adapt to compensate for any resulting error.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"The experimental results show this is extremely effective, yielding models with 4 bit or 3 bit weights with essentially no reduction in accuracy.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"While at 2 bits the accuracy decreases slightly, the results are substantially better than those achieved with other quantization approaches.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"Overall this paper is clear, the technique is as far as I am aware novel, the experiments are thorough and the results are very compelling, so I recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,The paper could use another second pass for writing style and grammar.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"Also, the description of the pruning-inspired partitioning strategy could be clarified somewhat...",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"e.g., the chosen splitting ratio of 50% only seems to be referenced in a figure caption and not the main text.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,The idea of this paper is reasonable - gradually go from original weights to compressed weights by compressing a part of them and fine-tuning the rest.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,"Everything seems fine, results look good, and my questions have been addressed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyQJ-mclg,To improve the paper:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into discriminator to improve the stability and quality of GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"Different to Denoising Feature Matching, EBGAN uses encoder-decoder instead of denoising only, and use hingle loss to replace original loss function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"The theoretical results are good, and empirical result of high resolution image is unique among all recent GAN advantages.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,I suggest to introduce Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching as related work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,This paper introduces an energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and provides theoretical and empirical results modeling a number of image datasets (including large-scale versions of categories of ImageNet).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"As far as I know energy-based GANs (EBGAN) were introduced in Kim and Bengio (2016), but the proposed version makes a number of different design choices.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"First, it does away with the entropy regularization term that Kim and Bengio (2016) introduced to ensure that the GAN discriminator converged to an energy function proportional to the log density of the data (at optimum).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"This implies that the discriminator in the proposed scheme will become uniform at convergence as discussed in the theoretical section of the paper, however the introductory text seems to imply otherwise",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,that one could recover a meaningful score function from the trained energy-function (discriminator).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,This should be clarified.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"Second, this version of the EBGAN setting includes two innovations: (1) the introduction of the hinge loss in the value function, and (2) the use of an auto-encoder parametrization for the energy function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"These innovations are not empirically justified in any way - this is disappointing, as it would be really good to see empirical results supporting the arguments made in support of their introduction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,The two significant contributions of this paper are the theoretical analysis of the energy-baesd GAN formalism (showing that the optimum corresponds to a Nash equilibrium) and the impressive empirical results on large images that set a new standard in what straight GAN-style models can achieve.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,The theoretical results seem solid to me and make a nice contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"Regarding the quantitative results in Table 2, it seems not appropriate to bold the EBGAN line when it seems to be statistically indistinguishable form the Rasmus et al (2015) results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"Though it is not mentioned here, the use of bold typically indicates the state-of-the-art.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,I think this paper could be be much stronger if the two novel contributions to the energy-based GAN setting were more thoroughly explored with ablation experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,"That being said, I think this paper has already become a contribution other are building on (including at least two other ICLR submissions) and so I think it should be accepted for publication at ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,This paper proposes a novel extension of generative adversarial networks that replaces the traditional binary classifier discriminator with one that assigns a scalar energy to each point in the generator's output domain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,The discriminator minimizes a hinge loss while the generator attempts to generate samples with low energy under the discriminator.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryh9pmcee,The authors show that a Nash equilibrium under these conditions yields a generator that matches the data distribution (assuming infinite capacity).,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,This paper presents a new type of language model that treats entity references as latent variables.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"The paper is structured as three specialized models for three applications: dialog generation with references to database entries, recipe generation with references to ingredients, and text generation with coreference mentions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Despite some opaqueness in details that I will discuss later, the paper does a great job making the main idea coming through, which I think is quite interesting and definitely worth pursuing further.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"But it seems the paper was rushed into the deadline, as there are a few major weaknesses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,The first major weakness is that the claimed latent variables are hardly latent in the actual empirical evaluation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"As clarified by the authors via pre-review QAs, all mentions were assumed to be given to all model variants, and so, it would seem like an over-claim to call these variables as latent when they are in fact treated as observed variables.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,Is it because the models with latent variables were too difficult to train right?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,A related problem is the use of perplexity as an evaluation measure when comparing reference-aware language models to vanilla language models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Essentially the authors are comparing two language models defined over different event space, which is not a fair comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Because mentions were assumed to be given for the reference-aware language models, and because of the fact that mention generators are designed similar to a pointer network, the probability scores over mentions will naturally be higher, compared to the regular language model that needs to consider a much bigger vocabulary set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,The effect is analogous to comparing language models with aggressive UNK (and a small vocabulary set) to a language models with no UNK (and a much larger vocabulary set).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"To mitigate this problem, the authors need to perform one of the following additional evaluations: either assuming no mention boundaries and marginalizing over all possibilities (treating latent variables as truly latent), or showing other types of evaluation beyond perplexity, for example, BLEU, METEOR, human evaluation etc on the corresponding generation task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,The other major weakness is writing in terms of technical accuracy and completeness.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,I found many details opaque and confusing even after QAs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"I wonder if the main challenge that hinders the quality of writing has something to do with having three very specialized models in one paper, each having a lot of details to be worked out, which may have not been extremely important for the main story of the paper, but nonetheless not negligible in order to understand what is going on with the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Perhaps the authors can restructure the paper so that the most important details are clearly worked out in the main body of the paper, especially in terms of latent variable handling — how to make mention detection and conference resolution truly latent, and if and when entity update helps, which in the current version is not elaborated at all, as it is mentioned only very briefly for the third application (coreference resolution) without any empirical comparisons to motivate the update operation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"This paper explores 3 language modeling applications with an explicit modeling of reference expressions: dialog, receipt generation and coreferences.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"While these are important tasks for NLP and the authors have done a number of experiments, the paper is limited for a few reasons:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"1. This paper is not clearly written and is pretty hard to follow some details. In particular,  there are many obvious math errors, such as missing the marginalization sum in Eq (1), and P(z_{i,v}...) = 1 (should be 0 here) on page 5, pointer switch section.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,2. The major novelty seems to be the 2-dimensional attention from the table and the pointer to the 2-D table. These are more of a customization of existing work to a particular task with 2-D tables as a part of the input to seq2seq model with both attentions and pointer networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"3. The empirical results are not very conclusive yet, limited by either the relatively small data size, or the lack of well-established baseline for some new applications (e.g., the recipe generation task).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Overall, this paper, as it is for now, is more suitable for a workshop rather than for the main conference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"This paper introduces pointer-network neural networks, which are applied to referring expressions in three small-scale language modeling tasks: dialogue modeling, recipe modeling and news article modeling.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"When conditioned on the co-reference chain, the proposed models outperform standard sequence-to-sequence models with attention.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"The proposed models are essentially variants of pointer networks with copy mechanisms (Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2016), which have been modified to take into account reference chains.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"As such, the main architectural novelty lies in 1) restricting the pointer mechanism to focus on co-referenced entities, 2) applying pointer mechanism to 2D arrays (tables), and 3) training with supervised alignments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Although useful in practice, these are minor contributions from an architectural perspective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,The empirical contributions are centred around measuring perplexity on the three language modeling tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Measuring perplexity is typical for standard language modeling tasks, but is really an unreliable proxy for dialogue modeling and recipe generation performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"In addition to this, both the dialogue and recipe tasks are tiny compared to standard language modeling tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of the dialogue and recipe modeling results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"For example, if one was to bootstrap from a larger corpus, it seems likely that a standard sequence-to-sequence model with attention would yield performance comparable to the proposed models (with enough data, the attention mechanism could learn to align referring entities by itself).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,The language modeling task on news article (Gigaword) seems to yield the most conclusive results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"However, the dataset for this task is non-standard and results are provided for only a single baseline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByG8A7cee,"Overall, this limits the conclusions we can draw from the empirical experiments.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"In this paper, the authors proposed a extension to the DQN algorithm by introducing both an upper and lower bound to the optimal Q function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,The authors show experimentally that this approach improves the data efficiency quite dramatically such that they can achieve or even supersede the performance of DQN that is trained in 8 days.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,The idea is novel to the best of my knowledge and the improvement over DQN seems very significant.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"As I suspect, some of the improvements that comes from the bounds is due to the fact that multi-step returns is used effectively.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"Therefore, I was wondering whether the authors have tried any approach like Retrace or Tree backup by Precup et al. and if so how do these methods stack up against the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,The author have very impressive results and the paper proposes a very promising direction for future research and as a result I would like to make a few suggestions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"First, it would be great if the authors could include a discussion about deterministic vs stochastic MDPs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"Second, it would be great if the authors could include some kind of theoretically analysis about the approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"Finally, I would like to apologize for the late review.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"In this paper, a Q-Learning variant is proposed that aims at ""propagating"" rewards faster by adding extra costs corresponding to bounds on the Q function, that are based on both past and future rewards.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"This leads to faster convergence, as shown on the Atari Learning Environment benchmark.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,The paper is well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"The core idea of using relaxed inequality bounds in the optimization problem is original to the best of my knowledge, and results seem promising.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,This submission however has a number of important shortcomings that prevent me from recommending it for publication at ICLR:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"1. The theoretical justification and analysis is very limited. As far as I can tell the bounds as defined require a deterministic reward to hold, which is rarely the case in practice. There is also the fact that the bounds are computed using the so-called ""target network"" with different parameters theta-, which is another source of discrepancy. And even before that, the bounds hold for Q* but are applied on Q for which they may not be valid until Q gets close enough to Q*. It also looks weird to take the max over k in (1, ..., K) when the definition of L_j,k makes it look like the max has to be L_j,1 (or even L_j,0, but I am not sure why that one is not considered), since L*_j,0 >= L*_j,1 >= ... >= L*_j,K. Neither of these issues are discussed in the paper, and there is no theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,[Update: some of these concerns were addressed in OpenReview comments],0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"2. The empirical evaluation does not compensate, in my opinion, for the lack of theory. First, since there are two bounds introduced, I would have expected ""ablative"" experiments showing the improvement brought by each one independently. It is also unfortunate that the authors did not have time to let their algorithm run longer, since as shown in Fig. 1 there remain a significant amount of games where it performs worse compared to DQN. In addition, comparisons are limited to vanilla DQN and DDQN: I believe it would have been important to compare to other ways of incorporating longer-term rewards, like n-step Q-Learning or actor-critic. Finally, there is no experiment demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can indeed improve other existing DQN variants: I agree with the author when they say ""We believe that our method can be readily combined with other techniques developed for DQN"", however providing actual results showing this would have made the paper much stronger.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"In conclusion, I do believe this line of research is worth pursuing, but also that additional work is required to really prove and understand its benefits.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,Minor comments:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,"I am not sure what you mean by ""a series of past states"", since Q is defined as Q(s, a) and thus can only take the current state s as input, when defined this way.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ8Je4clg,Could the ideas in this paper be extended to methods for continuous control like DDPG or NAF?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1oWlN9ll,This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton’s method to learn binary DNN.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,"As correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,"With regards to multimodal learning, this paper offers incremental advancements since it primarily uses a novel combination of input modalities (audio and images).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,"However, bidirectional image/audio retrieval has already been explored by the authors in prior work (Harwath et al, NIPS 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,"Apart from minor differences in data and CNN architecture, the training procedure in this submission is identical to this prior work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,The novelty in this submission is therefore the procedure for using the trained model for associating image regions with audio subsequences.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,The methods employed for this association are relatively straightforward combination of standard techniques with limited novelty.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkbc-Vqeg,The trained model is used to compute alignment scores between densely sampled image regions and audio subsequences; from these alignment scores a number of heuristics are applied to associate clusters of image regions with clusters of audio subsequences.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The authors describe a system for solving physics word problems.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"On the dataset that the authors synthesize, the full system attains near full performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"Outside of the pipeline, the authors also provide some network activation visualizations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"The paper is clear, and the data generation procedure/grammar is rich and interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"However, overall the system is not well motivated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"Why did they consider this particular problem domain, and what challenges did they specifically hope to address?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"Is it the ability to label sequences using LSTM networks, or the ability to classify what is being asked for in the question?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"This has already been illustrated, for example, by work on POS tagging and by memory networks for the babi tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"A couple of standard architectural modifications, i.e. bi-directionality and a content-based attention mechanism, were also not considered.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"Given a natural language query sampled from a fixed grammar, the system uses two LSTM models to extract key components, e.g., physical parameters and the type of questions being asked, which are then sent to a numerical integrator for the answer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The overall performance in the test set is almost perfect (99.8%).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,Overall I found this paper quite interesting to read (and it is well written).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"However, it is not clear how hard the problem is and how much this approach could generalize over more realistic (and complicated) situations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The dataset are a bit small and might not cover the query space.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,It might be better to ask AMT workers to come up with more complicated queries/answers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The physics itself is also quite easy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,What happens if we apply the same idea on billiards?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"In this case, even we have a perfect physics simulator, the question to be asked could be very deep and requires multi-hop reasoning.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,It is a bit disappointing to see that DNN is only used to extract the parameters while still a traditional approach is used for core reasoning part.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,It would be more interesting to see the other way round.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The paper uses neural networks to answer falling body physics questions by 1.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"Overall, the paper is clearly written and seems to be novel in its approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,The main problems I see with this work are:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"1. The task is artificial, and it's not clear how hard it is. The authors provide no baseline nor do they compare it to any real world problem. Without some measure of difficulty it's hard to tell if a much simple approach will do better, or if the task even makes sense.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyFkG45gl,"2. The labler LSTM uses only 10 hidden units. This is remarkably small for language modeling problems, and makes one further wonder about the difficulty of the task. The authors provide no reasoning for this choice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"The authors present TARTAN, a derivative of the previously published DNN accelerator architecture: “DaDianNao”.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The key difference is that TARTAN’s compute units are bit-serial and unroll MAC operation over several cycles.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,This enables the units to better exploit any reduction in precision of the input activations for improvement in performance and energy efficiency.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"1. I second the earlier review requesting the authors to be present more details on the methodology used for estimating energy numbers for TARTAN. It is claimed that TARTAN gives only a 17% improvement in energy efficiency. However, I suspect that this small improvement is clearly within the margin of error ij energy estimation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"2. TARTAN is a derivative of DaDianNao, and it heavily relies the overall architecture of DaDianNao. The only novel aspect of this contribution is the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit, which (unfortunately) turns out to incur a severe area overhead (of nearly 3x over DaDianNao's compute units).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"3. Nonetheless, the idea of bit-serial computation is certainly quite interesting. I am of the opinion that it would be better appreciated (and perhaps be even more relevant) in a circuit design / architecture focused venue.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The paper describes how the DaDianNao (DaDN) DNN accelerator can be improved by employing bit serial arithmetic.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,They replace the bit-parallel multipliers in DaDN with multipliers that accept the weights in parallel but the activations serially (serial x parallel multipliers).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,They increase the number of units keeping the total number of adders constant.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,This enables them to tailor the time and energy consumed to the number of bits used to represent activations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,They show how their configuration can be used to process both fully-connected and convolutional layers of DNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Using variable precision for each layer of the network is useful - but was previously reported in Judd (2015),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Good evaluation including synthesis - but not place and route - of the units.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Also this evaluation is identical to that in Judd (2016b),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The idea of combining bit-serial arithmetic with the DaDN architecture is a small one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The authors have already published almost everything that is in this paper at Micro 2016 in Judd (2016b).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The increment here is the analysis of the architecture on fully-connected layers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Everything else is in the previous publication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The energy gains are small - because the additional flip-flop energy of shifting the activations in almost offsets the energy saved on reducing the precision of the arithmetic.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The authors don’t compare to more conventional approaches to variable precision - using bit-parallel arithmetic units but data gating the LSBs so that only the relevant portion of the arithmetic units toggle.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"This would not provide any speedup, but would likely provide better energy gains than the bit-serial x bit-parallel approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Overall:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"The Tartan and Stripes architectures are interesting but the incremental contribution of this paper (adding support for fully-connected layers) over the three previous publications on this topic, and in particular Judd (2016b) is very small.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"This idea is worth one good paper, not four.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"This seems like a reasonable study, though it's not my area of expertise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"I found no fault with the work or presentation, but did not follow the details or know the comparable literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"There seem to be real gains to be had through this technique, though they are only in terms of efficiency in hardware, not changing accuracy on a task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The tasks chosen (Alexnet / VGG) seem reasonable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The results are in simulation rather than in actual hardware.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"The topic seems a little specialized for ICLR, since it does not describe any new advances in learning or representations, albeit that the CFP includes ""hardware"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,I think the appeal among attendees will be rather limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,Please learn to use parenthetical references correctly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,As is your references make reading harder.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,I do not feel very qualified to review this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"I studied digital logic back in university, that was it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,I think the work deserves a reviewer with far more sophisticated background in this area.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,It certainly seems useful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,My advice is also to submit it another venue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,This paper proposed a hardware accelerator for DNN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,It utilized the fact that DNN are very tolerant to low precision inference and outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator by 1.90x without any loss in accuracy while it is 1.17x more energy efficient.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,TRT requires no network retraining.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,It achieved super linear scales of performance with area.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The first concern is that this paper doesn't seem very well-suited to ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,The circuit diagrams makes it more interesting for the hardware or circuit design community.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"The second concern is the ""take-away for machine learning community"", seeing from the response, the take-away is using low-precision to make inference cheaper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,This is not novel enough.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,"In last year's ICLR, there were at least 4 papers discussing using low precision to make DNN more efficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy-lMNqex,These ideas have also been explored in the authors' previous papers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,I would like first to apologize for the delay.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Summary: A framework for two-samples statistical test using binary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,classification is proposed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,It allows multi-dimensional sample testing and,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,an interpretability that other tests lack.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,A theoritical analysis is,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,provided and various empirical tests reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,A very interesting approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,I have however two main concerns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The clarity of the presentation is obscured by too much content.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,It would,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,be more interesting if the presentation could be somewhat,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,self-contained.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,You could consider making 2 papers out of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Seriously, you cram a lot of experiments in this paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,But the setting,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,of the experiments is not really explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,We are supposed to have read,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Jitkrittum et al., 2016, Radford et al., 2016, Yu et al., 2015, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,All,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,this is okay but reduces your public to a very few.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"For example, if I am not mistaken, you never explained what SCF is, despite",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,the fact that its performances are reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"As a second point, given also that the number of submissions to this conference are exploding,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,I would like to challenge you with the following question:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Why is this work significant to the representation learning community?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The submission considers the setting of 2-sample testing from the perspective of evaluating a classifier.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"For a classifier between two samples from the same distribution, the distribution of the classification accuracy follows a simple form under the null hypothesis.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"As such, a straightforward threshold can be derived for any classifier.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Finding a more powerful test then amounts to training a better classifier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"One may then focus efforts, e.g. on deep neural networks, for which statistics such as the MMD may be very difficult to characterize.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The approach is sound and very general,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The paper is timely in that deep learning has had huge impacts in classification and other prediction settings, but has not had as big an impact on statistical hypothesis testing as kernel methods have",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The discussion of the relationship to kernel-MMD has not always been as realistic as it could have been.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"For example, the kernel-MMD can also be seen as a classifier based approach, so a more fair discussion could be provided.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Also, the form of kernel-MMD used in the comparisons is a bit contradictory to the discussion as well",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The linear kernel-MMD is used which is less powerful than the quadradic kernel-MMD (the authors have justified this from the perspective of computation time),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* The kernel-MMD is argued against due to its unwieldy distribution under the null, but the linear time kernel-MMD (see also Zaremba et al., NIPS 2013) has a Gaussian distribution under the null.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Arthur Gretton's comment from Dec 14 during the discussion period was very insightful and helpful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"If these insights and additional experiments comparing the kernel-MMD to the classifier threshold on the blobs dataset could be included, that would be very helpful for understanding the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The open review format gives an excellent opportunity to assign proper credit for these experiments and insights by citing the comment.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,## Paper summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The paper reconsiders the idea of using a binary classifier to do two-sample testing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The idea is to split the sample into two disjoint training and test sets, train a classifier on the training set, and use the accuracy on the test set as the test statistic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"If the accuracy is above chance level, one concludes that the two samples are from different distributions i.e., reject H0.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,A theoretical result on an asymptotic approximate test power is provided.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"One implication is that the test is consistent, assuming that the classifier is better than coin tossing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Experiments on toy problems, evaluation of GANs, and causal discovery verify the effectiveness of the test.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"In addition, when the classifier is a neural net, examining the first linear filter layer allows one to see features which are most activated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The result is an interpretable visual indicator of how the two samples differ.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,## Review summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The paper is well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The idea of using a binary classifier for a two-sample testing is not new, as made clear in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The main contributions are the analysis of the asymptotic test power, the use of modern deep nets as the classifier in this context, and the empirical studies on various tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The empirical results are satisfactorily convincing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Although not much discussion is made on why the method works well in practice, overall contributions have a potential to start a new direction of research on model criticisms of generative models, as well as visualization of where a model fails.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,I vote for an acceptance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,## Major comments / questions,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,My main concern is on Theorem 1 (asymptotic test power) and its assumptions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"But, I understand that these can be fixed as discussed below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* Under H0, the distribution of the test statistic (i.e., sum of 0-1 classification results) follows Binomial(nte, 1/2) as stated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"However, under H1, terms in the sum are independent but *not* identical Bernoulli random variable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"This is because each term depends on a data point z_i, which can be from either P or Q.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"So, in the paragraph in Sec3.1: ""... the random variable n_te \hat{t} follows a Binomial(nte, p)..."" is not correct.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Essentially p depends on z_i.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,It should follow a Poisson binomial distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* In the same paragraph, for the same reason, the alternative distribution of Binomial(nte, p=p_{risk}) is probably not correct.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,I guess you mention it to use Moivre-Laplace to get the asymptotic normality.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Anyway, I see no reason why you would need this statement as the Binomial is not required in the proof, but only its asymptotic normality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"A variant of the central limit theorem (instead of the Moivre-Laplace theorem) for independent, non-identical variables would still allow you to conclude the asymptotic normality of the Poisson binomial (with some conditions).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,See for example http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5347/how-can-i-efficiently-model-the-sum-of-bernoulli-random-variables,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,The statement in Theorem 1 should be more precise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"For instance, ""Assume the assumptions on the classifier given in the previous paragraph.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Then, for large n, the power of C2ST is approximate \Phi(..).""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The current version is ""The power of C2ST is \Phi(..).""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* The proof of Theorem 1 should be more precise regarding which quantities are exact, which are approximate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"Both the null and alternative normal distributions are approximate for finite nte, for instance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,* It is unclear to me why the paper includes independence tests in the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,It does imply that the proposed test can be used to do an independence test.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"But, isn't this also true for other two-sample tests where x,y can be stacked together?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"This seems ad-hoc and raises further questions regarding the consistency, what type of dependency can be detected, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,These points are not discussed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* Comment: By using classification accuracy as a proxy, one should expect the test power, for a given sample size n, to be lower than a direct statistic like MMD.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"A vague analogy would be the t-test (based on the values of the data) vs. the sign test (based on only whether x_i < y_j, not the actual values).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"The classifier test is in some sense reminiscent of the sign test i.e., passing data points through a classifier and binarizing the output.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"For sufficiently large n, the test can still correctly detect the difference as shown empirically.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,## Minor comments / questions,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* Section 2, in the paragraph on the four steps of testing, the random variable for the statistic T is undefined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,"* In the last paragraph of Sec.2: ""kernel two-sample tests require the prescription of a manually-engineered representation of the data under study, and return values in units that are difficult to interpret.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,This is too vague.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJkXfE5xx,Manually-engineered representation?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"The reason I am commenting here is because, having looked at several comment sections for this ICLR, I am seeing a general trend that reviews have a strong focus on performance, i.e. reviews tend to be very short and judge papers, to a large degree, on whether they are a few percentage points better or worse than the reported baseline.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"E.g. see the comments ""the experimental evaluation is not convincing, e.g. no improvement on SVHN"" or ""the effect of drop-path seems to vanish with data augmentation"" below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"I believe that papers should be judged more on their scientific contributions (see points (1), (2) and (4) below), especially when those papers themselves state that their focus is on those scientific contributions, not on amazing performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Further, I believe the trend to focus excessively on performance is problematic for a number of reasons:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- The Deep Learning community has focused very heavily on a few datasets (MNIST, ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN). This means that at any time, a large chunk of the deep learning literature is battling for 5 SOTA titles. Hence, expecting any new model to attain one of those titles is a very high bar.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- It is an arbitrary standard. Say the SOTA on ImageNet improves by 2% a year. Then a paper that outperforms by 1% in 2014 would underperform by 1% in 2015. By the performance standard, the same paper with the same ideas and the same scientific merit would have declined drastically in value over that one year. Is that really true?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- How does one even draw a ""fair comparison"" on these standard datasets at this point? The bag of tricks for neural networks includes: drop-out, l2, l1, ensembling, various forms of data augmentation, various forms of normalization and initialization, various non-linearities, various learning rate schedules, various forms of pooling, label smoothing, gradient clipping etc. etc. There are a gazillion ways to eke out fractions of percentage points of performance. And - every single paper has a unique combination of tricks that they use for their model, even though the tricks themselves are unrelated to the model. Hence, the only truly fair comparison would be to compare against every reference model with the exact trick combination that the paper presenting the reference model used, which would take an exorbitant amount of time. What's worse, many papers do not even report all of the tricks they used. One would have to get the authors code and reverse engineer the model, not to mention slight differences introduced by using e.g. TensorFlow vs. Torch vs. Caffe. In this light, the request from one of the reviewers to have a baseline ""against which the improvements can be clearly demonstrated by making isolated changes"" seems unrealistic to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- The ML community should not make excessive fine-tuning of models mandatory for publication. By requiring models to beat SOTA, we force each author to fine-tune their model ad nauseum, which leads to an arms race. To get a publications, authors would spend ever more time fine-tuning their models. This can not only lead to ""training on the test set"", but also wastes the time of researcher that could be better spent exploring new ideas.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- It gives too much power to bad research. In science, there is always a certain background rate of ""bad"" results published: either the numbers are outright fake or the experimental protocol was invalid, e.g. someone used the test set as a validation set or someone did an exorbitant number of random reruns and only published the best single result. What's worse, these ""bad"" results are far more likely to hold the SOTA title at any given time than a ""good"" result. By requiring new publications to beat SOTA, we give too much power to bad results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"- It punishes authors for reporting many or strong baselines. In this paper, authors were careful to report many recent results. Table 1 is thorough. And now they are criticized for not beating all of those baselines. I have a feeling that if the authors of this paper had been more selective about which baselines they report, i.e. those that they can beat, they would have received higher scores on the paper. I have written an in-depth review for another paper at this conference that used, in my opinion, very weak baselines and ended up getting high reviewer marks. I don't think that was a coincidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"The same arguments apply, though I think to a lesser degree, to judging models excessively on how many parameters they have or their runtime.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"However, I agree with reviewers that more information about how models compare in terms of those metrics would enhance this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,I would like to see a discussion of that in the final version.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"In general, I think this paper would benefit from an appendix with more details on model and training procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"I also agree with reviewers that 80 layers, which is the deepest that authors can go while improving test error (Table 3), is not ultra-deep.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Hence putting ""ultra-deep"" in the paper title seems exaggerated and I would recommend scaling back the language.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"However, I don't think being ultra-deep (~1000 layers) is necessary, because as Veit et al showed, networks that appear ultra deep might not be ultra deep in practice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Training an 80-layer net that functions at test time without residual connections seems to be enough of an achievement.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"In summary, I think if a paper makes scientific contribution (see points (1), (2) and (4) below) independent of performance, then competitive performance should be enough for publication, instead of requiring SOTA.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,I believe this paper achieves that mark.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,This paper proposes a new architecture that does not explicitly use residuals but constructs an architecture that is composed of networks with fractal structure by using expand and join operations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Using the fractal architecture,  authors argue and try to demonstrate that the large nominal network depth with many short paths is the key for 'training 'ultra-deep” networks while residuals are incidental.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,The main bottleneck of this paper is that number of parameters needed for the FractalNet is significantly higher than the baselines which makes it hard to scale to ''ultra-deep” networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Authors replied that Wide ResNets also require many parameters but this is not the case for ResNet and other ResNet variants.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"ResNet and ResNet with Stochastic depth scales to depth of 110 with 1.7M parameters and to depth of 1202 with 10.2M parameters which is much less than the number of parameters for depths of 20 and 40 in Table 1(Huang et al, 2016a).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,It is not clear whether FractalNet can perform better than these depths with a reasonable computation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Authors report less parameters for 40 layers but this scaling trick is not validated for other depths including depth 20 in Table 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"On the other hand, the number of parameters for 40 layers with scaling trick is clearly still large compared to most of the baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Unsatisfactory comparison to these baselines makes the claims of authors unconvincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Authors also claim that drop-path to provide improvement compared to layer dropping procedure in Huang et al, 2016b however the results show that the empirical gain of this specific regularization disappears when well-known data augmentation techniques applied.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Therefore the empirical effectiveness of drop-path is not convincing too.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"DenseNets (Huang et al, 2016a) should be also included in the comparison since it outperforms most of the state of art Res Nets on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet and more importantly outperforms the proposed FractalNet significantly and it requires significantly less computation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Table 1 has Res-Net variants as baselines however Table 2 has only ResNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,Therefore ImageNet comparison only shows that one can run FractalNet on ImageNet and can perform comparably well to ResNet which is not a satisfactory result given the improvements of other baselines over ResNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"In addition, there is no improvement in SVHN dataset results and this is not discussed in the empirical analysis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Also, authors give a list of some improvements over Inception (Szegedy et al., 2015) but again these intuitive claims about effectiveness of these changes are not supported with any empirical analysis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Although the paper attempts to explore many interesting intuitive directions using the proposed architecture, the empirical results are not support the given claims and the large number of parameters makes the model restrictive in practice hence the contribution does not seem to be significant.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"In Table 1 comparisons to Resnets, the resnets from He et al. 2016b and Wide Resnets should be compared to FractalNet (in lieu of a proper baseline).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"The authors compare to other results without augmentation, but did not perform additional experiments without augmentation for these architectures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,The 40 layer Fractal Net should not be compared to other models unless the parameter reduction tricks are utilized for the other models as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,A proper comparison to Inception networks should also be performed for these networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,My guess is that the reason behind a seemingly 'ad-hoc' design of Inception modules is to reduce the computational footprint of the model (which is not a central motivation of fractal nets).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1VaB4cex,"Since this model is directly related to the Inception module due to use of shorter and longer paths without shortcuts, one can easily simplify the Inception design to build a strong baseline e.g. by converting the concatenation operation to a mean operation among equally sized convolution outputs.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryZqPN5xe,One of the big questions for me while reading the paper was how would an ensemble of 2 pre-trained nets would do on the tasks that the authors consider.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryZqPN5xe,"This is especially relevant in the cars classification example, where I suspect that a strong baseline is that of fine-tuning VGG on this task, fine-tuning resnet on this task, and possibly training a linear combination of the two outputs or just averaging them naively.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk2TqVcxe,The relation network is built in two stages.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk2TqVcxe,First a lower-level structure analyzes a pair of input entities.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk2TqVcxe,pooling techniques that induce invariance can be used to learn relations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk2TqVcxe,The idea builds on pooling structures (e.g. spatial/temporal average/max pooling) to focus on pairwise relations.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,Preliminary Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,A good first step in the research direction of learning dialogue agents from unstructured user interaction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"The goal of this paper is to analyze the behaviour of dialogue agents when they must answer factoid questions, but must query an oracle for additional information.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,This can be interpreted as a form of interaction between the dialogue agent and a ‘teacher’.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,The problem under investigation is indeed very important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,The authors create a synthetic environment in which to test their agent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"The main strength of the paper is that the paper tests many different combinations of environments, where either some knowledge is missing (and the agent has to query for it), or there is some misspelling in the teacher’s question, and different ways the agent can ask for extra information.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"I am a bit concerned that many of the tasks are too easy (e.g. the AQ question paraphrase), and I am also concerned that the environment presented is very limited, and quite far (in terms of richness of linguistic structure) from how real humans would interact with chatbots.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"I think the paper would be better positioned as testing the basic reasoning capabilities of agents/ their ability to do question answering, rather than dialogue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"However, I think the ‘ground-up’ approach that starts with simple environments is indeed worthy of analysis, and this paper makes an interesting contribution in that direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"Of course, the paper would be much more convincing with human experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,Additional notes:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"I think the simulation, in the synthetic environment, for the first mistake a learner can make during dialogue: “the learner has problems understanding the surface form of the text of the dialogue partner, e.g., the phrasing of a question”, is particularly limited since only word misspellings are considered (and the models used don’t work at the character level), which is of course only a tiny fraction of ways an agent can misunderstand the context.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,I would be particularly interested to see some discussion of how the authors plan to scale this up to more realistic settings.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,EDIT: I have updated my score to reflect the addition of the Mechanical Turk experiments,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) learned through previously proposed supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"In this setup, it is demonstrated that the agent learning from feedback (e.g. through question asking or question clarification) performs better.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,The motivation for the paper is excellent; dialogue agents which learn directly from unstructured human feedback (as opposed to reward signals alone) could be very useful in real-world applications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"However, the paper falls short on the execution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"All the numerous experiments presented are based on the synthetic dialogue simulator, which is highly artificial and different from real-world dialogues.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"The simulator is based on a simple factoid question-answering framework, which normally is not considered dialogue and which appears to be solvable with a few hand-crafted rules.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"The framework also assumes that the user's feedback is always correct and is given in one of a handful of forms (e.g. paraphrase of original question without typos) and that the agent can learn from examples of another agent asking questions or making clarifications, which simplifies the task even further.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"Because of the artificial setting and limited scope of the experiments, it seems difficult to draw conclusions about how to learn from unstructured user feedback.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkE8pVcle,"To test the hypothesis that it is possible to learn from such user feedback, I would strongly recommend the authors to continue working on this project by carrying out experiments with real human users (even in the factoid question answering domain, if necessary).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle,Also in this case of kernel SVMs the computational cost is likely to skyrocket and the method will have scaling issues.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle,"Is this the reason why the method is too expensive to use on CIFAR10 from scratch, and prompts doing LBP first?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle,Error correcting output coding is well established supervised learning approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle,Stacking several layers of ECOC seems a natural way of extending the framework to deep learning.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkz6aNqle,The first layer predicts this ECOC from the input data and each successive layer takes as output its preceding layer to predict another ECOC.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,This is a parallel work with BiGAN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The idea is using auto encoder to provide extra information for discriminator.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"After reading the rebuttal, I decided to increase my score.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,I think ALI somehow stabilizes the GAN training as demonstrated in Fig.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,Initial Review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,This paper proposes a new method for learning an inference network in the GAN framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,ALI's objective is to match the joint distribution of hidden and visible units imposed by an encoder and decoder network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"ALI is trained on multiple datasets, and it seems to have a good reconstruction even though it does not have an explicit reconstruction term in the cost function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,This shows it is learning a decent inference network for GAN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,There are currently many ways to learn an inference network for GANs: One can learn an inference network after training the GAN by sampling from the GAN and learning a separate network to map X to Z.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,There is also the infoGAN approach (not cited) which trains the inference network at the same time with the generative path.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,I think this paper should have an extensive comparison with these other methods and have a discussion for why ALI's inference network is superior to previous works.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"Since ALI's inference network is stochastic, it would be great if different reconstructions of a same image is included.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,I believe the inference network of the BiGAN paper is deterministic which is the main difference with this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,So maybe it is worth highlighting this difference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"The quality of samples is very good, but there is no quantitative experiment to compare ALI's samples with other GAN variants.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,So I am not sure if learning an inference network has contributed to better generative samples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,Maybe including an inception score for comparison can help.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,There are two sets of semi-supervised results:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The first one concatenate the hidden layers of the inference network and uses an L2-SVM afterwards.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"Ideally, concatenating feature maps is not the best way for semi-supervised learning and one would want to train the semi-supervised path at the same time with the generative path.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"It would have been much more interesting if part of the hidden code was a categorical distribution and another part of it was a continuous distribution like Gaussian, and the inference network on the categorical latent variable was used directly for classification (like semi-supervised VAE).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"In this case, the inference network would be trained at the same time with the generative path.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"Also if the authors can show that ALI can disentangle factors of variations with a discrete latent variable like infoGAN, it will significantly improve the quality of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The second semi-supervised learning results show that ALI can match the state-of-the-art.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,But my impression is that the significant gain is mainly coming from the adaptation of Salimans et al. (2016) in which the discriminator is used for classification.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,It is unclear to me why learning an inference network help the discriminator do a better job in classification.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,How do we know the proposed method is improving the stability of the GAN?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,My understanding is that one of the main points of learning an inference network is to learn a mapping from the image to the high-level features such as class labels.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,So it would have been more interesting if the inference path was directly used for semi-supervised learning as I explained above.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,"The joint distribution on x,z is then modeled using a joint generator model p(x,z)=p(z)p(x|z).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,Both q and p are then trained by trying to fool a discriminator.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,This constitutes a worthwhile extension of GANs: giving GANs the ability to do inference opens up many applications that could previously only be addressed by e.g. VAEs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The results are very promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,The CIFAR-10 samples are the best I've seen so far (not counting methods that use class labels).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ElR4cgg,Matching the semi-supervised results from Salimans et al. without feature matching also indicates the proposed method may improve the stability of training GANs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"As discussed, the there are multiple concurrent contributions in different packages/submission by the authors that are in parts difficult to disentangle.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Despite this fact, it is impressive to see a system learning from natural feedback in an online fashion.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"To the best of my knowledge, this is a new quality of result that was achieved - in particular as close to full supervision results are reached in some cases in this less constraint setting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,several points were raised that were in turn addressed by the authors:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,1. formalisation of the task (learning dialogue) is not precise. when can we declare success?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,The answer of the authors is partially satisfying.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"For this particular work, it might make sense to more precisely set goals e.g. to be as good as full supervision.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,2. (along the line of the previous question:) dialogue can be seen as a form of noisy supervision. can you please report the classic supervision baselines for the particular model used? this would give a sense what fraction of the best case performance is achieved via dialogue learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,The authors provided additional information along those lines - and I think this helps to understand how much of the overall goal was achieved and open challenges.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"3. is there an understanding of how much more difficult the MT setting is? feedback could be hand labeled as positive or negative for an analysis (?). or a handcrafted baseline could be tested, that either extracts the reward via template matching … or maybe even uses the length of the feedback as a proxy/baseline. (it looks to me that short feedback is highly correlated with high reward / correct answer (?))",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"The authors replied - but it would have been clearer if they could have quantified such suggested baseline, in order to confirm that there is no simple handcrafted baseline that would do well on the data - but these concerns are marginal.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,4. relation to prior work Weston’16 is not fully clear. I understand that this submission should be understood as an independent submission of the prior work Weston’16 - and not replacing it. In this case Weston’16 makes this submission appear more incremental. my understanding is that the punch line of this submission is the online part that leads in turn to more exploration. Is there any analysis on how much this aspect matters? I couldn’t find this in the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,The authors clarified the raised issues.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,The application of reinforcement learning and in particular FP is convincing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,There is a incremental nature to the paper - and the impression is emphasised by multiple concurrent contributions of the authors on this research thread.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Comparison to prior work (in particular Weston'16), should be made more explicit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,Not only in text but also in the experiments - as the authors partially do in their reply to the reviewers question.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Nevertheless, this particular contribution is assessed as significant and worth sharing and seems likely to have impact on how we can learn in these less constraint setting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"As the authors state in the comments, it is closely related to the question answering problem with the exception that a teacher provides a response after the model’s answer, which does not always come with a positive reward.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Thus, the model must learn to use the teacher’s feedback to significantly improve performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Overall, the paper is written clearly, and several interesting models are tested.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"It is certainly only a limited form of dialogue that is considered (closer to question answering, since the questions do not require the agent to look further back into the context), but investigating in this direction could prove fruitful once the tasks are scaled up to be more difficult.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,My main concern is with the paper`s novelty.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"In the words of the authors, this paper has two primary differences with the work of Weston:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"“(i) That earlier work did not use the natural reinforcement learning/online setting, but “cheated” with a fixed policy given in advance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"It is important to address the realistic online setting and assess whether the methods, particularly FP, still work, or else what changes (e.g. exploration, balancing, see Fig 4 and Table 1) are needed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"(ii) That earlier work had only simulated data, and no real-language data, so was only toy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"This work uses Mechanical Turk to do real experiments, which again is important to assess if these methods, particularly FP, work on real language.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Point (ii) is very much appreciated, but adding additional human testing data is not sufficient for a conference paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Thus, the main point of the paper is that “the model also works if we collect the data online (i.e. the agent’s policy is used to collect data rather than a fixed policy beforehand)”.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"While this is a step in the right direction, I’m not sure if it’s significant enough for an ICLR paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,Little model novelty is required to solve this additional requirement on these tasks beyond using epsilon greedy exploration.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"Thus, the paper is borderline accept/reject.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgXCV9xx,"EDIT: I have updated my score slightly in light of the author's response, where they make a good point that real-world implementation should be more strongly considered as part of the contribution.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S13wCE9xx,"Admittedly, Riemannian optimization avoids the rotational degree of freedom (the invertible matrix S you are mentioning in sec 2.3), but I am not 100% certain at this point this is the source of your gain; learning curves of objectives would help to see if Riemannian optimization is indeed more effective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S13wCE9xx,Another detail I could not easily find is the following.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S13wCE9xx,You said a disadvantage of other approaches is that their factors W and C do not directly reflect similarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S13wCE9xx,"Did you try to multiply the factors W and C from other optimizers and then factorize the product using the method in section 2.3, and use the new W for your downstream tasks?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S13wCE9xx,"The evaluation doesn't show a dramatic advantage to RO-SGNS; the 1% difference on the word similarity benchmarks is within the range of hyperparameter effects (see ""Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings"", (Levy et al., 2015)).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,These reading comprehension datasets such as CNN/Daily Mail are on the simpler side because they do not generally involve chains of reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence as can be found in datasets like MCTest.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,"I appreciate the re-naming and re-writing of the paper to make it more clear that the aggregation readers are specifically learning a predicate structure, as well as the inclusion of results about dimensionality of the symbol space.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,There have been concerns about CNN/DailyMail dataset (Chen et al. ACL’16),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,and it is not clear to me whether the dataset supports investigation on logical structure of interesting kinds.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,Maybe it is bound to be rather about lack of logical structure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,"Second, I wish the discussion on predication sheds more practical insights into dataset design or model design to better tackle reading comprehension challenges.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,"In that sense, it may have been more helpful if the authors could make more precise analysis on different types of reading comprehension challenges, what types of logical structure are lacking in various existing models and datasets, and point to specific directions where the community needs to focus more.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,The paper proposed to analyze several recently developed machine readers and found that some machine readers could potentially take advantages of the entity marker (given that the same marker points out to the same entity).,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,This makes reading section 4 a bit frustrating.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,I am also not sure what is the take home message of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryWKREqxx,Does it mean that the entity marking should be used in the MR models?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"This is an interesting suggestion on how to prune neurons, but more experiments (on larger datasets) are probably need to be convincing that this is an approach that is guaranteed to work well.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"It seems like that for larger datasets, more noise outputs might have to be added to ensure higher correlations?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,Is there a downside to this in terms of the overall accuracy?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"The paper is presented clearly, and was definitely interesting to read, so I encourage the authors to continue this line of work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,This paper proposes and tests two ideas.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"(1) a method of pruning networks by identifying highly correlated neuron pairs, pruning one of the pair, and then modifying downstream weights to compensate for the removal (which works well if the removed neurons were highly correlated).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"(2) a method, dubbed NoiseOut, for increasing neuron correlation by adding auxiliary noise target outputs to the network during training.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"The first idea (1) is fairly straightforward, and it is not clear if it has been tried before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,It does seem to work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,The second idea (2) is of unclear value and seems to this reviewer that it may merely add a regularizing effect.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,Comments in this direction:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"- In Fig 4 (right), the constant and Gaussian treatments seem to produce the same effect in both networks, right? And the Binomial effect seems the same as No_Noise. If this is true, can we conclude that the NoiseOut targets are simply serving to regularize the network, that is, to reduce its capacity slightly?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"- To show whether this effect is true, one would need to compare to other methods of reducing the network capacity, for example: by reducing the number of neurons, by applying L2 regularization of various values, or by applying Dropout of various strengths. Fig 7 makes an attempt at this direction, but critically misses several comparison treatments: “Pruned without any regularization”, “Pruned with only L2”, and “Pruned with only DropOut”. Have these experiments been run? Can their results be included and used to produce plots like Fig 5 and Fig 7?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"Without these comparisons, it seems impossible to conclude that NoiseOut does anything but provide similar regularization to DropOut or L2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"The combined ideas (1) + (2) DO produce a considerable reduction in parameters, but sadly the experiments and exposition are somewhat too lacking to really understand what is going on.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"With a little more work the paper could be quite interesting, but as is it should probably not be accepted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,Additional comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"- Section 4 states: “In all of these experiments, the only stop criteria is the accuracy decay of the model. We set the threshold for this criteria to match the original accuracy; therefore all the compressed network have the same accuracy as the original network.” Is this accuracy the train accuracy or test accuracy? If train, then test accuracy needs to be shown (how much test performance is lost when pruning?). If test, then this would typically be referred to as “cheating” and so the choice needs to be very clearly stated and then defended.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"- Lowercase rho is used to indicate correlation but this is never actually specified, which is confusing for. Just state once that it indicates correlation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,- How do these results compare to other pruning methods? No numerical comparison is attempted.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,The paper proposes to prune a neural network by removing neurons whose operation is highly correlated with other neurons.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"The idea is nice and somewhat novel - most pruning methods concentrate on removal of individual weights, however I haven't done a through research on this topic.",1

This is not convincing. The only details are given in Figure 5, however this Figure disagrees with Table 2: in the Table, the number of parameters ranges from 40k-600k, while the Figure pictures the range 12k-24k. Unless more details are provided, simply claiming that a network can remove 50% neurons with no number on the degradation of accuracy is not convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"2. Theory. The proofs do not match the experimental conditions and make unreasonable assumptions. The proofs show that in the absence of biases a network with a constant output will have two correlated neurons that generate the output offset. However, this is exactly why networks have biases and doesn't explain why noise injection helps (the proof suggests that all should be fine with deterministic auxiliary neuron). My interpretation is that the noisy output injects gradient noise (see e.g. the concurrent ICLR submission https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe). As such the proof muddies the picture more than it helps in understanding what is happening.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJIY0E9ge,"The pruning idea has potential, however its efficiency must be more soundly demonstrated (please provide network accuracies at various pruning levels, the method removes one neuron at a time, this allows making of nice plots) rather than laconically stating that a degradation on mnist from 97% accuracy to 92% is not significant (Figure 5.).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"The idea to use hand-crafted rewards in such a way is great and seems promising for practical scenarios, where a musician would like to design a set of rules, rather than a set of melodies.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Even though some choices made along the way seem rather ad-hoc and simplistic from a music theoretical perspective, the results sound like an improvement upon the note RNN baseline, but we also don't know how cherry picked these results are.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I am not convinced that this approach will scale to much more complicated reward functions necessary to compose real music.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Maybe LSTMs are the wrong approach altogether if they have so much trouble learning to produce pleasant melodies from such a relatively big corpus of data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Aren't there any alternative differentiable models that are more suitable?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,What about dilated convolution based approaches?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"What I don't like about the paper is that the short melodies are referenced as compositions while being very far from meaningful music, they are not even polyphonic after all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I think it would be great if such papers would be written with the help or feedback of people that have real musical training and are more critical towards these details.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"What I like about the paper is that the authors make an effort to understand what is going on, table 1 is interesting for instance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"However, Figure 3 should have included real melody excerpts with the same sound synthesis/sample setup.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Besides that, more discussion on the shortcomings of the presented method should be added.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"In summary, I do like the paper and idea",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,and I can imagine that such RL based fine-tuning approaches will indeed be useful for musicians.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Even though the novelty might be limited, the paper serves as a documentation on how to achieve solid results in practice.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"The authors claim that the ""language-model""-type approaches with LSTMs generate melodies with certain shortcomings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"They tend to lack long-range structure, to repeat notes etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,To solve this problem the authors suggest that the model could be first trained as a pure LM-style LSTM and then trained with reinforcement learning to optimize an objective which includes some non-differentiable music-theory related constraints.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The reinforcement learning methodology is appropriate but straightforward and closely resembles previous work for text modeling and dialogue generation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,By itself the methodology doesn't offer a new technique.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"To me, the paper's contribution then comes down to the novelty / utility / impact of the application.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The authors clearly put substantial of effort into crafting the rules and user study and that is commendable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"On the other hand, music itself is dealt with somewhat naively.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"While the user study reflects hard work, it seems premature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The semi-plausible piano melodies here are only music in the way that LSTM Shakespeare passes as poetry.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,So it's analogous to conducting a user study comparing LSTM Shakespeare to n-gram Shakespeare.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I'd caution the author's against the uncritical motivation that a problem has previously been studied.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Research contains abundant dead ends (not to say this is necessarily one) and the burden to motivate research shouldn't be forgotten.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,This is especially true when the application is the primary thrust of a paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Generally the authors should be careful about describing this model as ""composing"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"By analogy to a Shakespeare-LSTM, the language model is not really composing English prose.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The relationship between constructing a statistical sequence model and creating art - an activity that involves communication grounded in real-world semantics should not be overstated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I appreciate the authors' efforts to respond to some criticisms of the problem setup and encourage them to anticipate these arguments in the paper and to better motivate the work in the future.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"If the main contribution is the application (the methods have been used elsewhere), then the motivation is of central importance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I also appreciate their contention that the field benefits from multiple datasets and not simply relying on language modeling.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Further, they are correct in asserting that MIDI can capture all the information in a score (not merely ""Gameboy music"", and that for some musics (e.g. European classical)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,the score is of central importance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"However, the authors may overstate the role of a score in jazz music.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Overall, for me, the application, while fun, doesn't add enough to the impact of the paper.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Update,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Thanks for your modifications and arguments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,I've revised my scores to add a point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,This paper uses a combination of likelihood and reward based learning to learn sequence models for music.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"The ability to combine likelihood and reward based learning has been long known, as a result of the unification of inference and learning first appearing in the ML literature with the EM formalism of Attias (2003) for fixed horizons, extended by Toussaint and Storkey (2006), to general horizon settings, Toussaint et al. (2011) to POMDPs and generalised further by Kappen et Al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,(2012) and Rawlik,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,et Al. (2012).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"These papers introduced the basic unification, and so any additional probabilistic or data driven objective can be combined with the reinforcement learning signal: it is all part of a unified reward/likelihood.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Hence the optimal control target under unification is p(b=1|\tau)E_p(A,S) \prod_t \pi(a_t|s_t): i.e. the probability of getting reward, and probability of the policy actions under the known data-derived distribution, thereby introducing the log p(a_t|s_t) into (9) too.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"The interpretation of the secondary objective as the prior is an alternative approach under a stochastic optimal control setting, but not the most natural one given the whole principle of SOC of matching control objectives to inference objectives.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The SOC off policy objective still does still contain the KL term so the approach would still differ from the approach of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Though the discussion of optimal control is good, I think some further elaboration of the history and how reward augmentation can work in SOC would be valuable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"This would allow SOC off-policy methods to be compared with the DQN directly, like for like.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,The motivation of the objective (3) is sensible but could be made clearer via the unification argument above.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Then the paper uses DCN to take a different approach from the variational SOC for achieving that objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,Another interesting point of discussion is the choice of E_pi \log p(a_t|s_t) – this means the policy must “cover” the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"But one problem in generation is that a well-trained model is often underfit, resulting in actions that, over the course of a number of iterations, move the state into data-unsupported parts of the space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,As a result the model is no longer confident and quickly tends to be fairly random.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"This approach (as opposed to a KL(p||pi) – which is not obvious how to implement) cannot mitigate against that, without a very strong signal (to overcome the tails of a distribution).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"In music, with a smaller discrete alphabet, this is likely to be less of a problem than for real valued policy densities, with exponentially decaying tails.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Some further discussion of what you see in light of this issue would be valuable: the use of c to balance things seems critical, and it seems clear from Figure 2 that the reward signal needed to be very high to push the log p signal into the right range.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Altogether, in the music setting this paper provides a reasonable demonstration that augmentation of a sequence model with an additional reward constraint is valuable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"It demonstrates that DQN is one way of learning that signal, but AFAICS it does not compare learning the same signal via other techniques.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Instead for the comparator techniques it reverts to treating the p(a|s) as a “prior” term rather than a reward term, leaving a bit of a question as to whether DQN is particularly appropriate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ8fyHceg,"Another interesting question for the discussion is whether the music theory reward could be approximated by a differentiable model, mitigating the need for an RL approach at all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The authors present a well thought out and constructed system for performing lipreading.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"The primary novelty is the end-to-end nature of the system for lipreading, with the sentence-level prediction also differentiating this with prior work.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"Overall, the work seems of high quality and clearly written with detailed explanations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The final results and analysis appear good as well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,One gripe is that that the novelty lies in the choice of application domain as opposed to the methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"Lack of word-level comparisons also makes it difficult to determine the importance of using sentence-level information vs. choices in model architecture/decoding, and finally, the GRID dataset itself appears limited with the grammar and use of a n-gram dictionary.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,UPDATE:  I have read the authors' responses.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,I did not read the social media comments about this paper prior to reviewing it.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,I appreciate the authors' updates in response to the reviewer comments.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"The authors have taken a task that had not yet been addressed with a straightforward modern deep learning approach, and addressed it with such an approach.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,************************,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,ORIGINAL REVIEW:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The authors show that an appropriately engineered LSTM+CNN+CTC network does an excellent job of lipreading on the GRID corpus.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,This is a nice result to know about,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better take into account the strong contraints.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"So I am not sure about the ""importance of spatiotemporal feature extraction"" as stated in the conclusion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"Some more minor comments, typos, etc.:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"citations for LSTMs, CTC, etc. should be provided the first time they are mentioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,I did not quite follow the justification for upsampling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"what is meant by ""lip-rounding vowels""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,They seem to include almost all English vowels.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,Did you consider keeping the vowel visemes V1-V4 separate rather than collapsing them into one?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"Since you list Neti et al.'s full viseme set, it is worth mentioning why you modified it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"""Given that the speakers are British, the confusion between /aa/ and /ay/...""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkjLkSqxg,"I am not sure what this has to do with British speakers, as the relationship between these vowels exists in other English dialects as well (e.g. American).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,This paper presents a meta-learning algorithm which learns to learn generative models from a small set of examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"It’s similar in structure to the matching networks of Vinyals et al. (2016), and is trained in a meta-learning framework where the inputs correspond to datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Results are shown on Omniglot in terms of log-likelihoods and in terms of generated samples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"The proposed idea seems reasonable, but I’m struggling to understand various aspects of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"The exposition is hard to follow, partly because existing methods are described using terminology fairly different from that of the original authors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Most importantly, I can’t tell which aspects are meant to be novel, since there are only a few sentences devoted to matching networks, even though this work builds closely upon them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"(I brought this up in my Reviewer Question, and the paper has not been revised to make this clearer.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,I’m also confused about the meta-learning setup.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"One natural formulation for meta-learning of generative models would be that the inputs consist of small datasets X, and the task is to predict the distribution from which X was sampled.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"But this would imply a uniform weighting of data points, which is different from the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Based on 3.1, it seems like one additionally has some sort of query q, but it’s not clear what this represents.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"In terms of experimental validation, there aren’t any comparisons against prior work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"This seems necessary, since several other methods have already been proposed which are similar in spirit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,This paper proposes an interesting idea for rapidly adapting generative models in the low data regime.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"The idea is to use similar techniques that are used in one-shot learning, specifically ideas from matching networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"To that end, the authors propose the generative matching networks model, which is effectively a variational auto-encoder that can be conditioned on an input dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Given a query point, the model matches the query point to points in the conditioning set using an attention model in an embedding space (this is similar to matching networks).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The results on the Omniglot dataset show that this method is successfully able to rapidly adapt to new input distributions given few examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"I think that the method is very interesting, however the major issue for me with this paper is a lack of clarity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"I outline more details below, but overall I found the paper somewhat difficult to follow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"There are a lot of details that I feel are scattered throughout, and I did not get a sense after reading this paper that I would be able to implement the method and replicate the results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"My suggestion is to consolidate the major implementation details into a single section, and be explicit about the functional form of the different embedding functions and their variants.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,I was a bit disappointed to see that weak supervision in the form of labels had to be used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,How does the method perform in a completely unsupervised setting?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,This could be an interesting baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,There is a lack of definition of the different functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Some basic insight into the functional forms of f, g, \phi, sim and R would be nice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Otherwise it is very unclear to me what’s going on.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Section 3.2: “only state of the recurrent controller was used for matching”, my reading of this section (after several passes) is that the pseudo-input is used in the place of a regular input.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Is this correct?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Otherwise, this sentence/section needs more clarification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"I noticed upon further reading in section 4.2 that there are two versions of the model: one in which a pseudo input is used, and one in which a pseudo input is not used (the conditional version).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,What is the difference in functional form between these?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"That is, how do the formulas for the embeddings f and g change between these settings?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,“since the result was fully contrastive we did not apply any further binarization” what does it mean for a result to be fully contrastive?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"For clarity, the figures and table refer to the number of shots, but this is never defined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,I assume this is T here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,This should be made consistent.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Figure 2: why is the value of T only 9 in this case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,What does it mean for it to be 0?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,It is stated earlier that T should go up to 20 (I assume #shot corresponds to T).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"It also looks like the results continue to improve with an increased number of steps, I would like to see the results for 5 and maybe 6 steps as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Presumably there will come a point where you get diminishing returns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Table 1: is the VAE a fair baseline?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,You mention that Ctest affects Pd() in the evaluation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The fact that the VAE does not have an associated Ctest implies that the two models are being evaluated with a different metric.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Can the authors clarify this?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,It’s important that the comparison is apples-to-apples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,MNIST is much more common than Omniglot for evaluating generative models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Would it be possible to perform similar experiments on this dataset?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,That way it can be compared with many more models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"Further, why are the negative log-likelihood values monotonically decreasing in the number of shots?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"That is, is there ever a case where increasing the number of shots can hurt things?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,What happens at T=30?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,40?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"As a minor grammatical issue, the paper is missing determiners in several sentences.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,“On figure 3” should be changed to “in figure 3” in the experiments section.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The paper explores a VAE architecture and training procedure that allows to generate new samples of a concept based on several exemplars that are shown to the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The proposed architecture processes the set of exemplars with a recurrent neural network and aggregation procedure similar to the one used in Matching Networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,"The resulting ""summary"" is used to condition a generative model (a VAE) that produces new samples of the same kind as the exemplars shown.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The proposed aggregation and conditioning procedure are better suited to sets of exemplars that come from several classes than simple averaging.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,Perhaps surprisingly the model generalizes from generation conditioned on samples from 2 classes to generation conditioned on samples from 4 classes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyCRyS9gx,The experiments are conducted on the OMNIGLOT dataset and are quite convincing.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,To be clear I think the TerpreT paper deserves a large amount of attention.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"This paper contradicts one of the key findings in the original paper but doesn't provide convincing evidence that gradient-based evaluators for TerpreT are superior or even, frankly, appropriate for program induction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,This is uncomfortable for me and makes me wonder why gradient-based methods weren't more carefully vetted in the first place or why more extensive comparisons to already implemented alternatives weren't included in this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"My opinion: if we want to give the original TerpreT paper more attention, which I think it deserves, then this paper is above threshold.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"On the other hand it's basically unreadable, actually contradicts its mother-paper in not well-defended ways, and is irreproducible without the same",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"It is also concerning that although  1) the tasks are simple, 2) the structure of the solution is very restricted and 3) model is using extensions doing most of the work, the proposed model still fails to find solutions (example: A+L model that has “loop” fails to solve “list length” task in 84% of the runs).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"Namely, here, they used the structure of the control flow (if-then-else, foreach, zipWithi, and foldli ""templates""), immutable data (no reuse of a ""neural"" memory), and types (they tried penalizing ill-typedness, and restricting the search only to well-typed programs, which works better).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpLeH9el,"My bird eye view would be that this stands in between ""make everything continuous and perform gradient descent"" (ML) and ""discretize all the things and perform structured and heuristics-guided combinatorial search"" (PL).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ25-B5eg,1. it is not very clear to me is your direct model in the experiments SSNT or sequence-to-sequence model?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ25-B5eg,"2. O(|x|^2*|y|) training complexity is OK, but it would be great to further cut down the computational cost, as it is still very expensive for long input sequences, for example, for paragraph or document level modeling, or speech sequences.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"I think that the paper convincingly proves that this method acts as a decent regularizer, but I'm not convinced that it's a competitive regularizer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"For example, I don't believe that there is sufficient evidence that it gives a better regularizer than dropout/normalization/etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I also think that it will be much harder to tune than these other methods (discussed in my rebuttal reply).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"Summary: If I understand correctly, this paper proposes to take the ""bottleneck"" term from variational autoencoders which pulls the latent variable towards a noise prior (like N(0,1)) and apply it in a supervised learning context where the reconstruction term log(p(x|z)) is replaced with the usual supervised cross-entropy objective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,The argument is that this is an effective regularizer and increases robustness to adversarial attacks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,The presentation is quite good and the paper is easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,The idea is reasonable and the relationship to previous work is well described.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"The robustness to adversarial examples experiment seems convincing, though I'm not an expert in this area.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"MNIST accuracy results don't seem very strong, unless I'm missing something.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,The Maxout paper from ICML 2013 listed many permutation invariant MNIST results with error rates below 1%.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,So the 1.13% error rate listed here doesn't necessarily prove that the method is a competitive regularizer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I also suspect that tuning this method to make it work well is harder than other regularizers like dropout.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"There are many distinct architectural choices with this method, particularly in how many hidden layers come before and after z.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"As far as I can tell the paper says that p(y | z) is a simple logistic regression (i.e. one weight matrix followed by softmax), but it's not obvious why this choice was made.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"The IB is potentially very useful for important applications (regularization, adversarial robustness, and privacy are mentioned in the paper).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Combining the IB with recent advances in deep learning to make it more widely applicable is an excellent idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"But given that the theoretical contribution is a fairly straight-forward application of well-known ideas, I would have liked to see a stronger experimental section.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Thank you for an interesting read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I personally like the information bottleneck principle and am very happy to see its application to deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"To my knowledge, this is the first paper that applies IB to train deep networks (the original papers only presented the concept), but see below for the note of independent work claim.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"The derivation of the variational lowerbound is very clear, even for those who are not very familiar with variational inference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Also the explanation of the IB principle is clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Experimental results seem to be very promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I found the presentation for the model a bit confusing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"In variational inference/information maximisation, p usually denotes the model and q represents the ""inference engine"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,This means the choice of inference method is independent to the modelling procedure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"However the presented VIB assumed p(x, y) as the **underlying data distribution** (and approximated by the empirical distribution), thus here the model is actually q(y|z)p(z|x).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"Then the authors presented p(y|x) as the **predictive distribution** in page 8, paragraph 2 of section 4.2.3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,Predictive in what sense?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I guess you meant p(y|x),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"= \int q(y|z) p(z|x) dz in this case, but this makes the two definitions contradict to each other!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,The authors have made an interesting connection to variational auto-encoder and the warm-up training (by tuning beta).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"However, even when the loss function formula is the same to the variational lowerbound used in VAE (in this case beta = 1), the underlying model is different!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"For example, r(z) in VIB is the variational approximation to p(z) (which means r(z) is not a component in the model), while in VAE it is the prior distribution which is actually defined in the modelling procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"Similaly p(z|x) in VIB is included in the model, while in VAE that is the approximate posterior and can be independently chosen (e.g. you can use p(x|z) as a deep NN but p(z|x) as a deep NN or a Gaussian process).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"In summary, I think the presentation for the modelling procedure is unclear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,I hope these point would be made clearer in revision since the current presentation makes me uncomfortable as a Bayesian person.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,It seems to me that nowadays deep learning research is very competitve that many people publish the same idea at the same time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxQzBceg,"So I would trust this claim and commend the authors' honesty, but in case this is not true, I would not recommend the manuscript for acceptance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This paper proposes a generative model for mixtures of basic local structures where the dependency between local structures is a tensor.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,They use tensor decomposition and the result of their earlier paper on expressive power of CNNs along with hierarchical Tucker to provide an inference mechanism.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"However, this is conditioned on the existence of decomposition.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"The authors do not discuss how applicable their method is for a general case, what is the subspace where this decomposition exists/is efficient/has low approximation error.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,Their answer to this question is that in deep learning era these theoretical analysis is not needed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"While this claim is subjective, I need to emphasize that the paper does not clarify this claim and does not mention the restrictions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Hence, from theoretical perspective, the paper has flaws and the claims are not justified completely.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,Some claims cannot be justified with the  current results in tensor literature as the authors also mentioned in the discussions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Therefore, they should have corrected their claims in the paper and made the clarifications that this approach is restricted to a clear subclass of tensors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"If we ignore the theoretical aspect and only consider the paper from empirical perspective, the experiments the appear in the paper are not enough to accept the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,MNIST and CIFAR-10 are very simple baselines and more extensive experiments are required.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Also, the experiments for missing data are not covering real cases and are too synthetic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Also, the paper lacks the extension beyond images.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Since the authors repeatedly mention that their approach goes beyond images, and since the theory part is not complete, those experiments are essential for acceptance of this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This paper uses Tensors to build generative models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"The main idea is to divide the input into regions represented with mixture models, and represent the joint distribution of the mixture components with a tensor.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Then, by restricting themselves to tensors that have an efficient decomposition, they train convolutional arithmetic circuits to generate the probability of the input and class label, providing a generative model of the input and labels.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This approach seems quite elegant.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"It is not completely clear to me how the authors choose the specific architecture for their model, and how these choices relate to the class of joint distributions that they can represent, but even if these choices are somewhat heuristic, the overall framework provides a nice way of controlling the generality of the distributions that are represented.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"The experiments are on simple, synthetic examples of missing data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"This is somewhat of a limitation, and the paper would be more convincing if it could include experiments on a real-world problem that contained missing data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"One issue here is that it must be known which elements of the input are missing, which somewhat limits applicability.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Could experiments be run on problems relating to the Netflix challenge, which is the classic example of a prediction problem with missing data?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"In spite of these limitations, the experiments provide appropriate comparisons to prior work, and form a reasonable initial evaluation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,I was a little confused about how the input of missing data is handled experimentally.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,From the introductory discussion my impression was that the generative model was built over region patches in the image.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This led me to believe that they would marginalize over missing regions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"However, when the missing data consists of IID randomly missing pixels, it seems that every region will be missing some information.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,Why is it appropriate to marginalize over missing pixels?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Specifically,  in Equation 6 represents a local region, and the ensuing discussion shows how to marginalize over missing regions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,How is this done when only a subset of a region is missing?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,It also seems like the summation in the equation following Equation 6 could be quite large.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,What is the run time of this?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,The paper is also a bit schizophrenic about the extent to which the results are applicable beyond images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,The motivation for the probabilistic model is mostly in terms of images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"But in the experiments, the authors state that they do not use state-of-the-art inpainting algorithms because their method is not limited to images and they want to compare to methods that are restricted to images.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This would be more convincing if there were experiments outside the image domain.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"It was also not clear to me how, if at all, the proposed network makes use of translation invariance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,It is widely assumed that much of the success of CNNs comes from their encoding of translation invariance through weight sharing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,Is such invariance built into the authors’ network?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"If not, why would we expect it to work well in challenging image domains?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"As a minor point, the paper is not carefully proofread.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,To just give a few examples from the first page or so:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,“provenly” -> provably,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,The paper provides an interesting use of generative models to address the classification with missing data problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,The tensorial mixture models proposed take into account the general problem of dependent samples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,This is an nice extension of current mixture models where samples are usually considered as independent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,Indeed the TMM model is reduced to the conventional latent variable models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"As much as I love the ideas behind the paper, I feel pitiful about the sloppiness of the presentation (such as missing notations) and flaws in the technical derivations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Before going into the technical details, my high level concerns are as follows:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(1) The joint density over all samples is modeled as a tensorial mixture generative model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,The interpretation of the CP decomposition or HT decomposition on the prior density tensor is not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"The authors have an interpretation of TMM as product of mixture models when samples are independent, however their interpretation seems flawed to me, and I will elaborate on this in the detailed technical comments below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(2) The authors employ convolution operators to compute an inner product.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"It is realizable by zero padding, but the invariance structure, which is the advantage of CNN compared to feed-forward neural network, will be lost.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"However, I am not sure how much this would affect the performance in practice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(3) The author could comment in the paper a little bit on the sample complexity of this method given the complexity of the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Because I liked the ideas of the paper so much, and the ICLR paper submitted didn't present the technical details well due to sloppiness of notations, so I read the technical details in the arXiv version the authors pointed out.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,There are a few technical typos that I would like to point out (my reference to equations are to the ones in the arXiv paper).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(1) The generative model as in figure (5) is flawed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"P(x_i|d_i;\theta_{d_i}) are vectors of length s, there the product of vectors is not well defined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,It is obvious that the dimensions of the terms between two sides of the equation are not equal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"In fact, this should be a tucker decomposition instead of multiplication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"It should be P(X) = \sum_{d1,\ldots,d_N} P(d_1,\ldots,d_N) (P(x_1|d_1;theta_{d_1},P(x_2|d_2;theta_{d_2},\ldots,P(x_N|d_N;theta_{d_N}), which means a sum of multi-linear operation on tensor P(d_1,\ldots,d_N), and each mode is projected onto P(x_i|d_i;theta_{d_i}.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(2) I suspect the special case for diagonal Gaussian Mixture Models has some typos as I couldn't derive the third last equation on page 6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,But it might be just I didn't understand this example.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,(3) The claim that TMM reduces to product of mixture model is not accurate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"The first equation on page 7 is only right when ""sum of product"" operation is equal to ""product of sum"" operation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Similarly, in equation (6), the second equality doesn't hold unless in some special cases.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"However, this is not true.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJluGHcee,"Overall, I like the ideas behind this paper very much.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,This paper proposes an extension of the multiplicative RNN,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,[1] where the authors apply the same reparametrization trick to the weight matrices of the LSTM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"The paper proposes some interesting tricks, but none of them seems to be very crucial.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"For instance, in Eq.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"(16), the authors propose to multiply the output gate inside the activation function in order to alleviate the saturation problem in logistic sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"Also, the authors share m_t across the inference of different gating units and cell-state candidates, at the end this brings only 1.25 times increase on the number of model parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"Lastly, the authors use a variant of RMSProp where they add an additional hyper-parameter  and schedule it across the training time.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,It would be nicer to apply the same tricks to other baseline models and show the improvement with regard to each trick.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"With the new architectural modification to the LSTM and all the tricks combined, the performance is not as great as we would expect.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"Why didn’t the authors apply batch normalization, layer normalization or zoneout to their models?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,Was there any issue with applying one of those regularization or optimization techniques?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"At the fourth paragraph of Section 4.4, where the authors connect dynamic evaluation with fast weights is misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,I find it a bit hard to connect dynamic evaluation as a variant of fast weights.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,Fast weights do not use test error signal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"In the paper, the authors claim that “dynamic evaluation uses the error signal and gradients to update the weights, which potentially increases its effectiveness, but also limits its scope to conditional generative modelling, when the outputs can be observed after they are predicted”, and I am afraid to tell that this assumption is very misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,We should never assume that test label information is given at the inference time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,The test label information is there to evaluate the generalization performance of the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"In some applications, we may get the label information at test time, e.g., stock prediction, weather forecasting, however, in many other applications, we don’t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"For instance, in machine translation, we don't know what's the best translation at the end, unlike weather forecasting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"Also, it would be fair to apply dynamic evaluation to all the other baseline models as well to compare with the BPC score 1.19 achieved by the proposed mLSTM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"The quality of the work is not that bad, but the novelty of the paper is not that good either.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4kQHceg,"The performance of the proposed model is oftentime worse than other methods, and it is only better when dynamic evaluation is coupled together.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"First, I find the introduction of pruning lengthy and not particularly novel or surprising.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"For example, Fig 1 is not necessary, nor is most of the preamble section 3.3.0.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"The pruning algorithms themselves are sensible (though overly simplistic) approaches, which of course would not matter if they were effective in addressing the question.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"However, in looking for contributions this paper makes, an interesting, pithy, or novel take on pruning is not one of them, in my opinion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Second, and most relevant to my overall rating, Section 4 does not get deeper than scratching the surface.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,The figures do not offer much beyond the expected decay in performance as a percentage of neurons removed or gain value.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"The experiments themselves are not particularly deep, covering a toy problem and MNIST, which does not convince me that I can draw lessons to the broader story of neural networks more generally.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Third, there is no essential algorithmic, architectural, or mathematical insight, which I expect out of all but the most heavily experimental papers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"I did enjoy reading some of the introductions and background, in particular that of reminding readers of popular papers from the late 1980s and early 1990s.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,The idea of the proposal is straight forward: remove neurons based on the estimated change in the loss function from the packpropagation estimate with either first or second order backpropagation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,The results are as expected that the first order method is worse then the second order method which in turn is worse than the brute force method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"However, there are many reasons why I think that this work is not appropriate for ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"For one, there is now a much stronger comprehension of weight decay algorithms and their relation to Bayesian priors which has not been mentioned at all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,I would think that any work in this regime would require at least some comments about this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Furthermore, there are many statements in the text that are not necessarily true, in particular in light of deep networks with modern regularization methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"For example, the authors state that the most accurate method is what they call brute-force.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"However, this assumes that the effects of each neurons are independent which might not be the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,So the serial order of removal is not necessarily the best.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,I also still think that this paper is unnecessarily long and the idea and the results could have been delivered in a much compressed way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"I also don’t think just writing a Q&A section is not enough, and the points should be included in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,The paper introduces a new pruning method for neural networks based on the second-order Taylor expansion and compares the results against a first-order method and brute-force pruning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,It performs experiments of the three methods on several toy examples - including a two-layer network on MNIST - and shows that the second-order method behaves much worse then the brute-force baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"In addition, from the success of the brute-force pruning the authors conclude that the hypothesis of Mozer et al - that neurons either contribute to performance or cancel out the effect of other neurons - is probably correct.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"The authors put in considerable effort to explain all details of the paper clearly and at length, so the content of the paper is accessible even to people novel to pruning methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Additionally, the authors have very carefully answered all questions that were coming up through the pre-review and have been very responsive.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"My major criticism is that the paper lacks focus, does not have a concrete conclusion and does not explain what it adds to the literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"To make this apparent, I here summarise each paragraph of the conclusion section:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 1: We do not benchmark / Pruning methods do not fare well against brute-force baseline /,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Some evidence for hypothesis of Mozer & Smolensky, but further investigation needed",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 2: Introduced 2nd order Taylor method / Does not fare well against baseline,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 3: Re-training may help but is not fair,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 4: Brute-force can prune 40-70% in shallow networks,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 5: Brute-force less effective in deep networks,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Paragraph 6: Not all neurons contribute equally to performance of network,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"The title of the paper and answers of the authors to the pre-review questions seemed to strongly suggest that the paper is not about the new second-order method, is not about benchmarking pruning algorithms but is instead about the learnt representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"But only two or three sentences in the conclusion, and no sentence in the part on results in the abstract, even refers to neural representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,In an answer to the pre-review questions the authors stated:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"> Furthermore, we do not have to accept the conclusion that re-training is a necessary part of pruning because a brute force search reveals that neurons can in fact be",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,> pruned from trained networks in a piecemeal fashion with no retraining and minimal adverse effect on the overall performance of the network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,This would be,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"> impossible if neurons did not belong to the distinct classes we describe.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"But this can already be concluded from the 2nd order method, which has a similar characteristic and is based on other 2nd order methods (not shown here).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,What is the motivation to introduce a new 2nd order method here?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"In addition, some other minor conclusions about representations - in particular the cancellation effect - might be based on side-effects of the greedy serial pruning method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Optimally, one would need to consider all the different ways of pruning (which, of course, scales exponentially with the number of neurons and is computationally infeasible).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Notably, the authors do consider this limitation in the context of conventional pruning methods in the conclusions: ""Third, we assumed that pruning could be done in a serial fashion",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,[...].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"We found that all of these assumptions are deeply flawed in the sense that the true relevance of a neuron can only be partially approximated [...] at certain stages of the pruning process"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,But the brute-force pruning process is also serial - why is that not a problem?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,All in all it is unclear to me what the paper adds: there are little conclusions regarding the learnt representations nor is there sufficient benchmarking against state-of-the-art pruning methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"I would suggest to focus the paper in the following way: first, use a state-of-the-art pruning method from the literature (that works without re-training) or do not use any other pruning methods besides brute-force (depending on whether you want to compare pruning methods against brute-force, or want to learn something about the learnt representations).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"In this way you need to write little about this second-order tuning methods, and readers are not so easily confused about the purpose of this paper (plus it will be considerably shorter!).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,Then concentrate on 2-layer MNIST and a deeper CIFAR10 network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Further focus the paper by adding an itemised list of the exact contributions that you make, and streamline the paper accordingly.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,These measures could strongly boost the impact of your work but will require a major revision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"PS: I think the confusion starts with the following sentence in the abstract: ""In this work we set out to test several long-held hypothesis about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkV4VS9ll,"Both aspects are pretty orthogonal, but are completely mixed up in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,TLDR:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The authors present Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks (VCRNN).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"VCRNN is similar in nature to Adaptive Computation Time (Graves et al., 2016).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,=== Gating Mechanism ===,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"Based off this m_t vector, a D-first (D-first as in literally the first D RNN states) subset of the vanilla RNN state is gated to be updated or not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Extra hyperparams epsilon and \bar{m} are needed,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,authors did not give us a value or explain how this was selected or how sensitive and critical these hyperparms are.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"This mechanism while novel, feels a bit clunky and awkward.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"It does not feel well principled that only the D-first states get updated, rather than a generalized solution where any subset of the state can be updated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"A short section in the text comparing to the soft-gating mechanisms of GRUs/LSTMs/Multiplicative RNNs (Wu et al., 2016) would be nice as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,=== Variable Computation ===,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,One of the arguments made is that their VCRNN model can save computation versus vanilla RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"While this may be technically true, in practice this is probably not the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The size of the RNNs they compare to do not saturate any modern GPU cores.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"In theory computation might be saved, but in practice there will probably be no difference in wallclock time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"The authors also did not report any wallclock numbers, which makes this argument hard to sell.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,=== Evaluation ===,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,This reviewer wished there was more citations to other work for comparison and a stronger baseline (than just a vanilla RNN).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"First, LSTMs are very simple and quite standard nowadays",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,there is a lack of comparison to any basic stacked LSTM architecture in all the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The PTB BPC numbers are quite discouraging as well (compared to state-of-the-art).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The VCRNN does not beat the basic vanilla RNN baseline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"The authors also only cite/compare to a basic RNN architecture, however there has been many contributions since a basic RNN architecture that performs vastly better.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"(Note that I do not consider beating LSTMs, GRUs, or any method in particular as a prerequisite for acceptance, but the comparison nevertheless should be made.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"In pre-review responses the authors brought up that LSTMs perform more computation per timestep than Elman networks, and while that is true, this is an axis along which they can be compared, this factor controlled for (at least in expectation, by varying the number of LSTM cells), etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,A brief discussion of the proposed gating mechanism in light of the currently popular ones would strengthen the presentation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,2017/1/20:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"In light of my concerns being addressed I'm modifying my review to a 7, with the understanding that the manuscript will be amended to include the new comparisons posted as a comment.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,This paper describes a simple but clever method for allowing variable amounts of computation at each time step in RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The new architecture seems to outperform vanilla RNNs on various sequence modelling tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Visualizations of the assignment of computational resources over time support the hypothesis that the model is able to learn to assign more computations whenever longer longer term dependencies need to be taken into account.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The proposed model is evaluated on a multitude of tasks and its ability to outperform similar architectures seems consistent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Some of the tasks allow for an interesting analysis of the amount of computation the model requests at each time step.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,It’s very interesting to see how the model seems to use more resources at the start of each word or ASCII character.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I also like the investigation of the effect of imposing a pattern of computational budget assignment which uses prior knowledge about the task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The superior performance of the architecture is impressive but I’m not yet convinced that the baseline models had an equal number of hyperparameters to tune.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I’ll come back to this point in the next paragraph because it’s mainly a clarity issue.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The abstract claims that the model is computationally more efficient than regular RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,There are no wall time measurements supporting this claim.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"While the model is theoretically able to save computations, the points made by the paper are clearly more conceptual and about the ability of the model to choose how to allocate its resources.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,This makes the paper interesting enough by itself but the claims of computational gains are misleading without actual results to back them up.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I also find it unfortunate that it’s not clear from the text how the hyperparameter \bar{m} was chosen.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Whether it was chosen randomly or set using a hyperparameter search on held-out data influences the fairness of a comparison with RNNs which did not have a similar type of hyperparameter for controlling regularization like for example dropout or weight noise (even if regularization of RNNs is a bit tricky).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I don’t consider this a very serious flaw because I’m impressed enough by the fact that the new architecture achieves roughly similar performance while learning to allocate resources but I do think that details of this type are too important to be absent from the text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Even if the superior performance is due to this extra regularization controlling parameter it can actually be seen as a useful part of the architecture but it would be nice to know how sensitive the model is to its precise value.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"To my knowledge, the proposed architecture is novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The way the amount of computation is determined is unlike other methods for variable computation I have seen and quite inventive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Originality is one of this paper’s strongest points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,It’s currently hard to predict whether this method for variable computation will be used a lot in practice given that this also depends on how feasible it is to obtain actual computational gains at the hardware level.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"That said, the architecture may turn out to be useful for learning long-term dependencies.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I also think that the interpretability of the value m_t is a nice property of the method and that it’s visualizations are very interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,It might shed some more light into what makes certain tasks difficult for RNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Original clever idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Nice interesting visualizations.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Some experimental details are not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I’m not convinced of the strength of the baseline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,The paper shouldn’t claim actual computational savings without reporting wall-clock times.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Edit:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I'm very positively impressed by the way the authors ended up addressing the biggest concerns I had about the paper and raised my score.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Adding an LSTM baseline and results with a GRU version of the model significantly improves the empirical quality of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"On top of that, the authors addressed my question about some experimental detail I found important and promised to change the wording of the paper to remove confusion about whether the computational savings are conceptual or in actual wall time.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I think it's fine that they are conceptual only as long as this is clear from the paper and abstract.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"I want to make clear to the AC that since the changes to the paper are currently still promises, my new score should be assumed to apply to an updated version of the paper in which the aforementioned concerns have indeed been addressed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,Edit:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,"Since I didn't know that the difference with the SOTA for some of these tasks was so large, I had to lower my score again after learning about this.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1LVSrcge,I still think it's a good paper but with these results I cannot say that it stands out.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,The paper proposed a very complex compression and reconstruction method (with additional parameters) for reducing the memory footprint of deep networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,The authors show that this complex proposal is better than simple hashed net proposal.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,One question: Are you also counting the extra parameters for reconstruction network for the memory comparison?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,"Otherwise, the experiments are unfair.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,"Since hashing and reconstruction cost will dominate the feed-forward and back-propagation updates, it is imperative to compare the two methods on running time.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,Please also show the impact on running time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,Small improvements for a big loss in computational cost may not be acceptable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,I am not convinced that this method will be lightweight.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,"If we are allowed complicated compression and reconstruction then we can use any off-shelf methods, but the cost will be huge",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,The paper presents a method to reduce the memory footprint of a neural network at some increase in the computation cost.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,This paper is a generalization of HashedNets by Chen et al. (ICML'15) where parameters of a neural network are mapped into smaller memory arrays using some hash functions with possible collisions.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyanrrqlg,"While the authors mention the technique is only 20% slower (which I am pleasantly surprised by), I don't understand why this technique should ever be used over competing approaches for the kinds of networks the authors present experimental results on.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Orders of magnitude speedup over non-augmented baselines are presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,———,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,The proposed search for source code implementations based on a rather small domain specific language (DSL) is compelling but also expected to some degree,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Quality: The paper is well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail but the main story is well described.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Originality: The suggested idea to speed up search based techniques using neural nets is perfectly plausible.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Significance: The experimental setup is restricted to smaller scales but the illustrated improvements are clearly apparent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Details:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,————,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,1. The employed test set of 100 programs seems rather small. in addition the authors ensure that the test set programs are semantically disjoint from the training set programs. Could the authors provide additional details about the small size of the test set and how to the disjoint property is enforced?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,2. The length of the programs is rather small at this point in time. A more detailed ablation regarding the runtime seems useful. The search based procedure is probably still the computationally most expensive part. Hence the neural net provides some additional prior information rather than tackling the real task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then condition a search procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"This is an interesting approach, which make sense, as building a generative model of programs is a very complex task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"Faster computation times are shown in the experimental section with respect to baselines including DFS, Enumeration, etc. in a setup with very small programs of length up to 5 instructions have to be found.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"It is not clear to me how the proposed approach scales to larger programs, where perhaps many attributes will be on.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Is there still an advantage?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"The authors use as metric the time to find a single program, whose execution will result in the set of 5 input-output pairs given as input.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"However, as mentioned in the paper, one is not after a generic program but after the best program, or a rank list of all programs (or top-k programs) that result in a correct execution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Could the authors show experiments in this setting?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,would still be useful to have the proposed approach?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,what would the challenges be in this more realistic scenario?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,In the second experiment the authors show results where the length of the program at training time is different than the length at test time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"However, the results are shown when only 20% of the programs are finished.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Could you show results for finding all programs?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,The paper is missing an analysis of the results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,What type of programs are difficult?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,how often is the NNet wrong?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,how does this affect speed?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,what are the failure modes of the proposed method?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"The authors proposed to have a fix-length representation of the each input-output pair, and then use average pooling to get the final representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"However, why would average pooling make sense here?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"would it make more sense to combine the predictions at the decoder, not the encoder?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,Learning from only 5 executions seems very difficult to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,"For programs so small it might be ok, but going to more difficult and longer programs this setting does not seem reasonable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,In summary an interesting paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByldLrqlx,This paper tackles a problem that is outside my area of expertise so I might have miss something important.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,This paper proposes a model-based reinforcement learning approach focusing on predicting future rewards given a current state and future actions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"This is achieved with a ""residual recurrent neural network"", that outputs the expected reward increase at various time steps in the future.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, experiments are conducted on Atari games, with a simple playing strategy that consists in evaluating random sequences of moves and picking the one with highest expected reward (and low enough chance of dying).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"Interestingly, out of the 3 games tested, one of them exhibits better performance when the agent is trained in a multitask setting (i.e. learning all games simultaneously), hinting that transfer learning is occurring.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"This submission is easy enough to read, and the reward prediction architecture looks like an original and sound idea.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"There are however several points that I believe prevent this work from reaching the ICLR bar, as detailed below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"The first issue is the discrepancy between the algorithm proposed in Section 3 vs its actual implementation in Section 4 (experiments): in Section 3 the output is supposed to be the expected accumulated reward in future time steps (as a single scalar), while in experiments it is instead two numbers, one which is the probability of dying and another one which is the probability of having a higher score without dying.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"This might work better, but it also means the idea as presented in the main body of the paper is not actually evaluated (and I guess it would not work well, as otherwise why implement it differently?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"In addition, the experimental results are quite limited: only on 3 games that were hand-picked to be easy enough, and no comparison to other RL techniques (DQN & friends).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"I realize that the main focus of the paper is not about exhibiting state-of-the-art results, since the policy being used is only a simple heuristic to show that the model predictions can ne used to drive decisions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"That being said, I think experiments should have tried to demonstrate how to use this model to obtain better reinforcement learning algorithms: there is actually no reinforcement learning done here, since the model is a supervised algorithm, used in a manually-defined hardcoded policy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"Another question that could have been addressed (but was not) in the experiments is how good these predictions are (e.g. classification error on dying probability, MSE on future rewards, ...), compared to simpler baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"Finally, the paper's ""previous work"" section is too limited, focusing only on DQN and in particular saying very little on the topic of model-based RL.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,"I think a paper like for instance ""Action-Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks in Atari Games"" should have been an obvious ""must cite"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,instead of Morimoto et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,Overall I think the paper has some really promising ideas and encouraging,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe-Pr9le,results but is missing a few exploratory/ablation experiments and some polish.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,This paper shows that a deep RL approach augmented with auxiliary tasks improves performance on navigation in complex environments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"Specifically, A3C is used for the RL problem, and the agent is simultaneously trained on an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"While the use of auxiliary tasks to improve training of models including RL agents is not new, the main contribution here is the use of tasks that encourage learning an intrinsic representation of space and movement that enables significant improvements on maze navigation tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"The paper is well written, experiments are convincing, and the value of the auxiliary tasks for the problem are clear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"However, the contribution is relatively incremental given previous work on RL for navigation and on auxiliary tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"The work could become of greater interest provided broader analysis and insights on either optimal combinations of tasks for visual navigation (e.g. the value of other visual / geometry-based tasks), or on auxiliary tasks with RL in general.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"As it is, it is a useful demonstration of the benefit of geometry-based auxiliary tasks for navigation, but of relatively narrow interest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,I do like the demonstration that including learning of auxiliary tasks does not interfere with the RL tasks but even helps.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,This is also not so surprising with deep networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,The deep structure of the model allows the model to learn first a good representation of the world on which it can base its solutions for specific goals.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"While even early representations do of course depend on the task performance itself, it is clear that there are common first stages in sensory representations like the need for edge detection etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"Thus, training by additional tasks will at least increase the effective training size.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"It is of course unclear how to adjust for this to make a fair comparison, but the paper could have included some more insights such as the change in representation with and without auxiliary training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,I still strongly disagree with the implied definition of supervised or even self-supervised learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,The definition of unsupervised is learning without external labels.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,It does not matter if this comes from a human or for example from an expensive machine that is used to train a network so that a task can be solved later without this expensive machine.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,I would call EM a self-supervised method where labels are predicted from the model itself and used to bootstrap parameter learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"In this case you are using externally supplied labels, which is clearly a supervised learning task!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,This relatively novel work proposes to augment current RL models by adding self-supervised tasks encouraging better internal representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,The proposed tasks are depth prediction and loop closure detection.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"While these tasks assume a 3D environment as well some position information, such priors are well suited to a large variety of tasks pertaining to navigation and robotics.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,Extensive experiments suggest to incorporating such auxiliary tasks increase performance and to a large extent learning speed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"Additional analysis of value functions and internal representations suggest that some structure is being discovered by the model, which would not be without the auxiliary tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"While specific to 3D-environment tasks, this work provides additional proof that using input data in addition to sparse external reward signals helps to boost learning speed as well as learning better internal representation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"It is original, clearly presented, and strongly supported by empirical evidence.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"One small downside of the experimental method (or maybe just the results shown) is that by picking top-5 runs, it is hard to judge whether such a model is better suited to the particular hyperparameter range that was chosen, or is simply more robust to these hyperparameter settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,Maybe an analysis of performance as a function of hyperparameters would help confirm the superiority of the approach to the baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,My own suspicion is that adding auxiliary tasks would make the model robust to bad hyperparameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"Another downside is that the authors dismiss navigation literature as ""not RL"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMGPrcle,"I sympathize with the limit on the number of things that can fit in a paper, but some experimental comparison with such literature may have proven insightful, if just in measuring the quality of the learned representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"The paper introduces GA3C, a GPU-based implementation of the A3C algorithm, which was originally designed for multi-core CPUs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The main innovation is the introduction of a system of queues.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The queues are used for batching data for prediction and training in order to achieve high GPU occupancy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The system is compared to the authors' own implementation of A3C as well as to published reference scores.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The paper introduces a very natural architecture for implementing A3C on GPUs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,Batching requests for predictions and learning steps for multiple actors to maximize GPU occupancy seems like the right thing to do assuming that latency is not an issue.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The automatic performance tuning strategy is also really nice to see.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,I appreciate the response showing that the throughput of GA3C is 20% higher than what is reported in the original A3C paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,What is still missing is a demonstration that the learning speed/data efficiency is in the right ballpark.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,Figure 3 of your paper is comparing scores under very different evaluation protocols.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,These numbers are just not comparable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"The most convincing way to show that the learning speed is comparable would be time vs score plots or data vs score plots that show similar or improved speed to A3C. For example, this open source implementation seems to match the performance on Breakout: https://github.com/muupan/async-rl",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,One or two plots like that would complete this paper very nicely.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,I appreciate the additional experiments included in the revised version of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The learning speed comparison makes the paper more complete and I’m slightly revising my score to reflect that.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"Having said that, there is still no clear demonstration that the higher throughput of GA3C leads to consistently faster learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"With the exception of Pong, the training curves in Figure 6 seem to significantly underperform the original A3C results or even the open source implementation of A3C on Breakout and Space Invaders (https://github.com/muupan/async-rl).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,Thanks the authors for the replying to the questions and adjusting the paper to make it more clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,It's an interesting modification the the original algorithm.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,This paper introduces a 'GPU-friendly' variant of A3C which relaxes some synchronicity constraints in the original A3C algorithm to make it more friendly to a high-throughput GPU device.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The analysis of the effects of this added latency is thorough.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,The systems analysis of the algorithm is extensive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,One caveat is that the performance figures in Table 3 are hard to compare since the protocols vary so much.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"I understand that DeepMind didn't provide reproducible code for A3C, but I gather from the comment that the authors have re-implemented vanilla A3C as well, in which case it would be good to show what this reimplementation of A3C achieves in the same setting used by DM, and in the setting of the experiment conducted using GA3C (1 day).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1VGvBcxl,"It would be good to clarify in the text that the experimental protocol differed (top 5 out of 50 vs single run), and clarify why the discrepancy, even if the answer is that the authors didn't have time / resources to reproduce the same protocol.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,"Also, one of the main baselines, DIB has no-skip connections therefore this can negatively affect the fair comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,"The authors argue that they did not involve state of art Res Nets since their analysis focuses on the ensemble approach, however any potential improvement of the ensemble can be compensated with an inherent feature of Res Net variant.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,The boosting procedure can be computationally restrictive in case of ImageNet training and Res Net variants may perform much better in that case too.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,Therefore the baselines should include the state of art Res Nets and Dense Convolutional networks hence current results are preliminary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,"In addition, it is not clear how sensitive the boosting to the selection of injection point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,This paper adopts DIB to Res Nets and provides some empirical analysis however the contribution is not sufficiently novel and the empirical results are not satisfactory for demonstrating that the method is significant.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJIMPr9eg,"The paper doesn't compare to the literature, and CIFAR-10 results fail to improve upon rather simple, single-network published baselines (Springenberg et al, 2015 for example, obtains 92% without data augmentation) and I'm pretty sure there's a simple ResNet result somewhere that outshines these too.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,The authors proposed to use leaky rectified linear units replacing binary units in Gaussian RBM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,A sampling method was presented to train the leaky-ReLU RBM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,"In the experimental section, AIS estimated likelihood on Cifar10 and SVHN were reported.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,It's interesting for trying different nonlinear hidden units for RBM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,"However, there are some concerns for the current work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,1. The author did not explain why the proposed sampling method (Alg. 2) is correct. And the additional computation cost (the inner loop and the projection) should be discussed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,2. The results (both the resulting likelihood and the generative samples) of Gaussian RBM are much worse than what we have experienced. It seems that the Gaussian RBM were not trained properly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,3. The representation learned from a good generative model often helps the classification task when there are fewer label samples. Gaussian RBM works well for texture synthesis tasks in which mixing is an important issue. The authors are encouraged to do more experiments in these two direction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,"Based on previous work such as the stepped sigmoid units and ReLU hidden units for discriminatively trained supervised models, a Leaky-ReLU model is proposed for generative learning.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,A further contribution of the paper is in proposing a novel sampling scheme for the leaky RBM: one can run a much shorter Markov chain by initializing it from a sample of the leaky RBM with c=1 (which yields a standard multi-variate normal over the visibles) and then slowly annealing c.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,In low-dimension a similar scheme is shown to outperform AIS for estimating the partition function.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GEvHcee,Experiments are performed on both CIFAR-10 and SVHN.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,I will detail each cons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,a) Section 1:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,The author  motivates the use of scattering transform because it defines a contraction of the space that relies on geometric features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,""" The nonlinearity used in the scattering network is the complex modulus which is piecewise linear.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,A real modulus is piecewise linear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,A complex modulus has a shape of bell when interpreting C as R^2.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,Could you clarify?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,\Omega is not introduced.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,Could you give a precise reference (page+paper) of this claim: “Higher order nonlinearity refers to |x|^2 instead of |x| as it is usually done in the scattering network.” ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,Section 2:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,The motivation of the non-linearity is not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,"First, this non-linearity might potentially increase a lot the variance of your architecture since it depends on higher moments(up to 4).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,"I think a fair analysis would be to compute numerically the normalized variance (e.g. divided by the averaged l^2 norm), as a sanity check.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,"Mathematically, a small value, even 10^-1000 is still a non 0 value.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,A good criteria might be for instance to understand the amount of the energy that has been neglected.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,"Besides, a filter with compact support has a bad localisation property.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJiFvr9el,"I might be wrong, since this it not my work to do those calculus, but if you claim that your implementation is theoretically faster, you need to prove it, since I do not know any papers where scattering transform claims to be fastly implemented.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy8gdB9xx,This paper presents a set of experiments where via clever use of randomization and noise addition authors demonstrate the enormous modeling (memorization) power of the deep neural networks with large enough capacity.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy8gdB9xx,"As the authors point out, once model families reach a point where they have capacity to memorize train sets, the classical theory does not yield useful results that could give insight into generalization behavior of these models, leaving one to empirical studies and observations.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy8gdB9xx,"1. Given two different DNN architectures with the same number of parameters, why do certain architectures generalize better than others?

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,Weakness:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"1, As the current datasets are small (e.g., the average number of nodes per graph is around 30), it would be great to explore larger graph datasets to further investigate the method.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,I’m curious about how stable the algorithm is.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,This paper studies the graph embedding problem by using the encoder-decoder method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,The experimental study on real network data sets show the features extracted by the proposed model is good for classification.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,Weak points of this paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,1. Comparisons with state-of-art methods (Graph Kernels) is missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"2. The problem is not well motivated, are there any application of this. What is the different from the graph kernel methods? The comparison with graph kernel is missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"3. Need more experiment to demonstrate the power of their feature extraction methods. (Clustering, Search, Prediction etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,4. Presentation of the paper is weak. There are lots of typos and unclear statements.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"5. The author mentioned about the graph kernel things, but in the experiment they didn't compare them. Also, only compare the classification accuracy by using the proposed method is not enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,Authors take the skip-graph architecture (Kiros 2015) and apply it to classifying labeled graphs (molecular graphs).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"They do it by creating many sentences by walking the graph randomly, and asking the model to predict previous part and next part from the middle part.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,Activations of the decoder part of this model on a walk generated from a new graph are used as features for a binary classifier use to predict whether the molecule has anti-cancer properties.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"In a nutshell, the idea is to linearize the graph using random walks and to compute the embedding of the central segment of each walk using the skip-thought criterion.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSqjHqxg,"Being not an expert in biology, I can not comment whether or not this makes sense, but the gains reported in Table 2 are quite significant.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,The main idea here is to make the Jacobian that comes when using the change of variables formula (from data to latents) triangular - this makes the determinant easy to calculate and hence learning possible.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,"The paper nicely presents this core idea and a way to achieve this - by choosing special ""routings"" between the latents and data such that part of the transformation is identity and part some complex function of the input (a deep net, for example)",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,This paper proposes a new generative model that uses real-valued non-volume preserving transformations in order to achieve efficient and exact inference and sampling of data points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,The authors use the change-of-variable technique to obtain a model distribution of the data from a simple prior distribution on a latent variable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,"By carefully designing the bijective function used in the change-of-variable technique, they obtain a Jacobian that is triangular and allows for efficient computation.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,I didn’t see any analysis of the semantic meaningfulness of the latent space learned by real NVP.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx,Stronger evidence that the learned representations are actually useful for downstream tasks would be nice.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,Pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,This paper tackles a very crucial problem of understanding communications between 2 agents.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"As more and more applications of reinforcement learning are being explored, this approach brings us back to a basic question.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,Is the problem solving approach of machines similar to that of humans.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,The task is simple enough to make the post learning analysis intuitive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"It was interesting to see how informed agents made use of multiple symbols to transmit the message, where as agnostic agents relied only on 2 symbols.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,Cons,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"The task effectively boils down to image classification, if the 2 images sent are from different categories.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,The symbols used are effectively the image class which the second agent learns to assign to either of the images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"By all means, this approach boils down to a transfer learning problem which could probably be trained much faster than a reinforcement learning algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,To train natural language systems by putting multiple agents within an interactive referential communication game is very nice.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"As the authors mention, there has been some (although seemingly not much) previous work on using multi-agent games to teach communication, and it certainly seems like a direction worth pursuing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Moreover, the approach of switching between these games and some supervised learning, as in the experiment described in Section 5 and suggested in Section 6, seems particularly fruitful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Note: For “clarity”, I believe some of the network connections in Fig 1 have been omitted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"However, given the rather highly-customized architecture and the slightly hard-to-follow description in Section 3, the shorthand diagram only adds to the confusion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"The diagram probably needs to be fine-tuned, but at the very least (especially if I am misunderstanding it!), a caption must [still] be added to help the reader interpret the figure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Overall, the framework (Section 2) is great and seems quite effective/useful in various ways, the results are reasonable, and I expect there will be some interesting future variations on this work as well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Caveat: While I am quite confident I understood the paper (as per confidence score below), I do not feel I am sufficiently familiar with the most closely related literature to accurately assess the place of this work within that context.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"In this paper, a referential game is proposed between two agents.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,Both agents observe two images.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"The agents both get a reward, if the receiver agent can predict the target.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,The paper proposes to parametrize the agents as neural networks - with pretrained representations of the images as feature vectors - and train them using REINFORCE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"In this setting, it is shown that the agents converge to  optimal policies and that their learned communications (e.g. the symbolic code transmitted from the sender to the receiver) have some meaningful concepts.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"In this setting, the agents appear to learn even more meaningful concepts.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Finally, multi-game setup is proposed, where the sender agent is alternating between playing the game before and playing a supervised learning task (classifying images).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"Not surprisingly, when anchored to the supervised learning task, the symbolic communications have even more meaningful concepts.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,Learning shared representations for communication in a multi-agent setup is an interesting research direction to explore.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"This is a much harder task compared to standard supervised learning or single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, which justifies starting with a relatively simple task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"To the best of my knowledge, the approach of first learning communication between two agents and then grounding this communication in human language is novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8N3Sclg,"As the authors remark, this may be an alternative paradigm to standard sequence-to-sequence models which tend to focus on statistical properties of language rather than their functional aspects.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,This paper extends end-to-end CNN+RNN image captioning model with auxiliary attribute predictions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"It proposes five variants of network architectures, which take the attribute/image features in alternating orders or at every timestamp.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"The attributes (i.e., 1,000 most common words on COCO) are obtained by attribute classifiers trained by a multiple instance learning approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"The experiment results indicated that having these attributes as input improves captioning performance on standard metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr-D.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,NOVELTY + SIGNIFICANCE,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"All five variants of the network architectures, shown in Fig.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"1, have followed a standard seq-to-seq LSTM model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,The differences between these variants come from two aspects: 1. the order of image/attribute inputs; 2. whether to input attribute/image features at each time step.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,No architectural changes have been added to the proposed model over a standard seq-to-seq model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"The proposed approach achieves decent performance improvement over previous work, but the technical novelty of this work is significantly limited by existing work that used similar ideas.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"In particular, Fang et al. 2015 and You et al. 2016 have both used attributes for image captioning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,This work has used the same multiple instance learning procedure as Fang et al. 2015 to train visual detectors for common words and used detector outputs as conditional inputs to a language model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"In addition, the idea of using image feature as input to every RNN timestamp has been widely explored, for instance, in Donahue et al. 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,The authors did not offer a clear explanation about the technical contribution of this work over these existing approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,CLARITY,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"First, it is not clear to me which image features have been used by the baseline methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"As the baselines may rely on different image representations, the experiments would not offer a completely fair comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"For example, the results of the attention-based models in Table 1 are directly copied from Xu et al., 2015, which were reported with Oxford VGG features, instead of GoogLeNet used by LSTM-A. Even if the baselines do not use the same types of features, it should at least be explicitly mentioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Besides, the fact that the results of Table 1 and Table 2 are reported with different features (GoogLeNet v.s. ResNet) are not described clearly in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"“We select 1,000 most common words on COCO…” How would this approach guarantee that the selected attributes have clear semantic meanings, as many words among the top 1000 would be stop words, abstract nouns, non-visual verbs, etc.?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"It would be interesting to perform some quantitative analysis to see whether these 1000-dimensional attribute vectors actually carry semantic meanings, or merely capture biases of word distributions from the ground-truth captions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,One possible way to justify the importance of semantic attributes is to experiment with ground-truth attributes or attribute classifiers trained on annotated sources such as COCO-Attribute (Patterson et al. 2016) or Visual Genome (Krishna et al. 2016).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,EXPERIMENTS,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,It would be interesting to analyze how the behavior of the seq-to-seq model changes with respect to the additional attribute inputs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,My hypothesis is that the model’s word choices will shift towards words with high scores.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,This experiments will help us understand how the model can take advantage of the auxiliary attribute inputs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Since the attributes are selected as the most frequent words from COCO, it is likely for the model to overfit the metrics, such as BLEU, that rely on word matching.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"On the other hand, it has been shown that these automatic caption evaluation metrics do not necessarily correlate with human judgment.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Therefore, I think it is necessary to conduct a human study to convince the readers the quality improvement of the proposed model is not caused by overfitting to metrics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,SUMMARY,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,This paper demonstrates that image captioning can be improved by having attributes as auxiliary inputs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"However, the model has minor novelty given existing work that has explored similar ideas.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Besides, more analysis is necessary to demonstrate the semantic meanings of attributes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,A human study is recommended to justify the actual performance improvement.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Given these points to be improved, I would recommend rejecting this paper in its current form.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"The authors take a standard image captioning system and, in addition to the image, also condition the caption on a fixed vector of attributes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"These attributes are the top 1,000 most common words trained with MIL as seen in Fang et al. 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,The authors investigate 5 ways of plugging in the attributes vector for each image.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"More or less all of them turn out to work comparably (24 - 25.2 METEOR), but also a good amount better than a standard image captioning model (25.2 > 23.1 METEOR).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,At the time this approach was state of the art on the MS COCO leaderboard.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,I am conflicted judging these kinds of application-heavy papers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"It is clear that the technical execution is done relatively well, but there is little to take away or learn.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"I find it interesting and slightly surprising that you can boost image captioning results by appending these automatically-extracted attributes, but on the topic of how many people would find this relevant or how much additional work it can inspire I am not so sure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,The paper evaluates different variants to include attributes for caption generation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"Attributes are automatically learned from descriptions as in [Fang et al., 2015].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,Strength:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,1. The paper discusses and evaluates different variants to incorporate attribute and image representation in a recurrent network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,2. The paper reports improvements over state-of-the-art on the large-scale MS COCO image caption dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,1. The technical novelty of the paper is limited; it is mainly a comparison of different variants to include attributes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"2. While the exact way how attributes are used is different to prior work, the presented variants are not especially exiting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,3. The reported metrics are known to not always correlate very well with human judgments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"3.1. It would be good to additionally also report the SPICE (Anderson et al ECCV 2016) metric, which has shown good correlation w.r.t. human judgments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"3.2. In contrast to the arguments of the authors during the discussion period, I believe a human evaluation is feasible at least on a subset of the test set. In my experience, most authors will share their generated sentences if they did not publish them. Also, a comparison between the different variants should be possible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,4. Qualitative results:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,4.1. How do the different variants A1 to A5 compare? Is there a difference in the sentence between the different approaches?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,Page 8: “is benefited” -> benefits,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,"While the paper presents a valuable experimental evaluation with convincing results, the contribution w.r.t.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkdpaH9ll,to novelty and approach is limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,This paper develops a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of the training error.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,The result is quite general that covers the training of a wide range of neural network models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,The key idea of the paper is approximate the training loss by its linear approximation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Since its linearity in the variables (thus convex), the authors plug in results that has been developed in the literature of online learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,This paper has good novelty in using the Taylor approximation thus greatly simplifying the analysis of the behaviour of the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"However, there are two problems about the main result of this paper, Theorem 2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,1. It is not clear if the Taylor optimum would converge or not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"As noticed by the authors, the upper bound is path dependent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Appendix 3 tries to claim that this Taylor optimum indeed converges, but the proof is buggy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"In the proof of Lemma 2, it is proved that the difference between two sequential Taylor optimum is approaching 0.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,Note that this is actually weaker than being Cauchy sequence and insufficient to guarantee convergence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,2. The lefthand side of Equation (3) (I will denote it by L3 in this review) is not equivalent to training error.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,An upper bound on this average error is not sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the training error neither.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Take the gradient descent for example (thus each minibatch x_0^n is the whole training set), the convergence of the training error should be lim_{n -> \infty} l(f_{w^n}(x_0^n), y^n).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,The convergence of L3 is necessary but not sufficient to imply the convergence of the training error.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Another concern about Theorem 2 (but it is minor compared to the two problems mentioned above) is that to achieve the O(1/\sqrt{n}) rate, the algorithm has to pick a particular learning rate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,Larger or smaller learning rate (in the order of n) will lead to significantly worse regret.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"But in the experiments of the paper, the learning rates are not picked according to the theorem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Overall, this paper has a good motivation and good novelty.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,It could be further developed into a good paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"But due to the two problems and a buggy proof mentioned above, I think it is not ready for publish yet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,This paper adopts Taylor approximations of neural nets for separating convex and non-convex components of the optimization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,This enables them to bound the training error by the Taylor optimum and regret (theorem 2).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,This is a nice theoretical result applicable to popular deep nets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,The empirical studies back up the theoretical claim.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,It is interesting to derive such a bound and show it satisfies a regret bound along with empirical evidence on the CIFAR-10 for cross entropy loss and auto encoder for MSE loss.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"At least empirically, by comparing the observed training loss and taylor loss, the better a particular optimizer performs (training loss statement, not a validation or observed test statement) the smaller the difference between these two.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Also shown is the regret loss is satisfied at different scales of the network, by layer, neuron and whole network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"The Taylor approximation can be used to investigate activation configurations of the network, and used to connect this to difficulty in optimizing  at kinks in the loss surface, along with an empirical study of exploration of activation surface of the SGD/Adam/RMSprop optimizers, the more exploration the better the resulting training loss.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Not that it impacts the paper but the weaker performance of the SGD could be related to the fixed learning rate, if we anneal this learning rate, which should improve performance, does this translate to more exploration and tightening between the actual loss and the Taylor loss?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"It might be useful to use a cross validation set for some of the empirical studies, in the end we would like to say something about generalization of the resulting network",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWG0H5ge,"Is there a reason the subscript on the Jacobian changes to a_l in the <Gl,V> definition?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"This paper introduces an analytical performance model to estimate the training and evaluation time of a given network for different software, hardware and communication strategies.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,The paper is very clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"The authors included many freedoms in the variables while calculating the run-time of a network such as the number of workers, bandwidth, platform, and parallelization strategy.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,Their results are consistent with the reported results from literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"Furthermore, their code is open-source and the live demo is looking good.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"The authors mentioned in their comment that they will allow users to upload customized networks and model splits in the coming releases of the interface, then the tool can become very useful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"It would be interesting to see some newer network architectures with skip connections such as ResNet, and DenseNet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,In PALEO the authors propose a simple model of execution of deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,It turns out that even this simple model allows to quite accurately predict the computation time for image recognition networks both in single-machine and distributed settings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"The ability to predict network running time is very useful, and the paper shows that even a simple model does it reasonably, which is a strength.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"But the tests are only performed on a few networks of very similar type (AlexNet, Inception, NiN) and only in a few settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"Much broader experiments, including a variety of models (RNNs, fully connected, adversarial, etc.) in a variety of settings (different batch sizes, layer sizes, node placement on devices, etc.) would probably reveal weaknesses of the proposed very simplified model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,This is why this reviewer considers this paper borderline,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"it's a first step, but a very basic one and without sufficiently large experimental underpinning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"More experiments were added, so I'm updating my score.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,This paper is technically sound.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,It highlights well the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed simplified model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"In terms of impact, its novelty is limited, in the sense that the authors did seemingly the right thing and obtained the expected outcomes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,The idea of modeling deep learning computation is not in itself particularly novel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"As a companion paper to an open source release of the model, it would meet my bar of acceptance in the same vein as a paper describing a novel dataset, which might not provide groundbreaking insights, yet be generally useful to the community.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"In the absence of released code, even if the authors promise to release it soon, I am more ambivalent, since that's where all the value lies.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,"It would also be a different story if the authors had been able to use this framework to make novel architectural decisions that improved training scalability in some way, and incorporated such new insights in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,UPDATED: code is now available.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyVVJ85lg,Revised review accordingly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"First up, I want to point out that this paper is really long.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Like 17 pages long,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,without any supplementary material.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"While ICLR does not have an official page limit, it would be nice if authors put themselves in the reviewer's shoes and did not take undue advantage of this rule.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Having 1 or 2 pages in addition to the conventional 8 page limit is ok, but more than doubling the pages is quite unfair.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Now for the review: The paper proposes a new artificial dataset for sequence learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,I call it artificial because it was artificially generated from the original MNIST dataset which is a smallish dataset of real images of handwritten digits.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"In addition to the dataset, the authors propose to train recurrent networks using a schedule over the length of the sequence, which they call ""incremental learning"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The experiments show that their proposed schedule is better than not having any schedule on this data set.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Furthermore, they also show that their proposed schedule is better than a few other intuitive schedules.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The authors verify this by doing some ablation studies over the model on the proposed dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,I have following issues with this paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,I did not find anything novel in this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The proposed incremental learning schedule is nothing new and is a natural thing to try when learning sequences.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Similar idea have already been tried by a number of authors, including Bengio 2015, and Ranzato 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The only new piece of work is the ablation studies which the authors conduct to tease out and verify that indeed the improvement in performance is due to the curriculum used.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Furthermore, the authors only test their hypothesis on a single dataset which they propose and is artificially generated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Why not use it on a real sequential dataset, such as, language modeling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Does the technique not work in that scenario?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"In fact I am quite positive that for language modeling where the vocabulary size is huge, the performance gains will be no where close to the 74% reported in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,I'm not convinced about the value of having this artificial dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Already there are so many real world sequential dataset available, including in text, speech, finance and other areas.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,What exactly does this dataset bring to the table is not super clear to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"While having another dataset may not be a bad thing in itself, I almost felt that this dataset was created for the sole purpose of making the proposed ideas work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,It would have been so much better had the authors shown experiments on other datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"As I said, the paper is way too long.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,A significant part of the length of the paper is due to a collection of experiments which are completely un-related to the main message of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"For instance, the experiment in Section 6.2 is completely unrelated to the story of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Same is true with the transfer learning experiments of Section 6.4.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The submitted paper proposes a new way of learning sequence predictors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"In the lines of incremental learning and curriculum learning, easier samples are presented first and the complexity is increased during training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The particularity here is that the complexity is defined as the length of the sequences given for training, the premise being is that longer sequences are harder to learn, since they need a more complex internal representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The targeted application is sequence prediction from primed prefixes, tested on a single dataset, which the authors extract themselves from MNIST.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The idea in the paper is interesting and worth reading.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"There are also many interesting aspects of evaluation part, as the authors perform several ablation studies to rule out side-effects of the tests.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The proposed learning strategy is compared to other strategies.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"However, my biggest concern is still with evaluation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The authors tested the method on a single dataset, which is non standard and derived from MNIST.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Given the general nature of the claim, in order to confirm the interest of the proposed algorithm, it need to be tested on other datasets, public datasets, and on a different application.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The paper is too long and should be trimmed significantly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The transfer learning part (from prediction to classification) is a different story and I do not see a clear connection to the main contribution of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The presentation and organization of the paper could be improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,It is quite sequentially written and sometimes reads like a student's report.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The loss given in the long unnumbered equation on page 6 should be better explained: provide explanations for each term, and make clearer what the different symbols mean.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Learning is supervised, so which variables are predictions, and which are observations from the data (ground truth).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Names in table 2 do not correspond to the descriptions in section 4.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,This paper presents a thorough analysis of different methods to do curriculum learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The major issue I have with it is that the dataset used seems very specific and does not necessarily justified, as mentioned by AnonReviewer3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,It would have been great to see experiments on more standard tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Also, I really can't understand how the performance of FFNN models can be so good, please elaborate on this (see last comment).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"However, the paper is well written, the comparisons of the described methods are interesting and would probably apply to some other datasets as well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,The paper is way too long (18 pages!).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Please reduce it or move some of the results to an appendix section.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"The method described is extremely similar to the one described in Reinforcement learning neural turing machines (Zaremba et al., 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00521v3.pdf) where the authors progressively increase the length of training examples until the performance exceeds a given threshold.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,Maybe you should mention it.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,"Could you explain very briefly in the paper what ""4-connected"" and ""8-connected"" mean, for people not familiar with these terms?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,I agree that having gold pen stroke sequences would be nice and probably very good features to have for image classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_1L5gg,But how accurate are the constructed ones?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,This paper proposes to learn decomposition of sequences (such as words) for speech recognition.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,It addresses an important issue and I forsee it being useful for other applications such as machine translation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"While the approach is novel and well-motivated, I would very much like to see a comparison against byte pair encoding (BPE).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,BPE is a very natural (and important) baseline (i.e. dynamic vs fixed decomposition).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,The BPE performance should be obtained for various BPE vocab sizes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Minor points,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Did the learned decompositions correspond to phonetically meaningful units?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,From the example in the appendix it's hard to tell if the model is learning phonemes or just most frequent character n-grams.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Any thoughts on applications outside of speech recognition?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,If this is shown to be effective in other domains it would be a really strong contribution (but this is probably outside the scope for now).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Interesting paper which proposes jointly learning automatic segmentation of words to sub words and their acoustic models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"Although the training handles the word segmentation as hidden variable which depends also on the acoustic representations, during the decoding only maximum approximation is used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"The authors present nice improvements over character based results, however they did not compare results with word segmentation which does not assume the dependency on acoustic.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,In order to extract such segmentation several publicly open tools are available and should be cited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Some of those tools can also exploit the unigram probabilities of the words to perform their segmentations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"It looks that the improvements come from the longer acoustical units - longer acoustical constraints which could lead to less confused search -, pointing towards full word models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"In another way, less tokens are more probable due to less multiplication of probabilities.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"As a thought experiment for an extreme case: if all the possible segmentations would be possible (mixture of all word fragments, characters, and full-words), would the proposed model use word fragments at all?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,It would be good to show that the sub word model could outperform even a full-word model (no segmentation).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Would not it be more consistent then to use the maximum instead of sampling?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,Or is even getting the maximum is computationally too expensive?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQq185lg,"This submission proposes to learn the word decomposition, or word to sub-word sequence mapping jointly with the attention based sequence-to-sequence model.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,"I still think that it is a better fit for a venue with an explicit interest in more traditional Bayesian latent variable models (ICML, UAI, NIPS).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,This manuscript describes a novel Bayesian approach to transfer learning focused on online sequence modeling settings where he primary concern is less distribution drift in an ongoing sequence and more variability between individual sequences (since each sequence can be thought of as defining its own conditional distribution over subsequent states).,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,"The core model is an HMM, which they give a full Bayesian treatment; the central problem this introduces is that each new observation that arrives introduces an additional product term to the posterior that is itself a product over M components (clusters or hidden states).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,"This paper applies Bayesian moment matching (BMM) to this problem, in which the posterior is approximated via projection onto a more tractable distribution that is adjusted to match some moments of the posterior.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,The problem setting is very appropriately framed as online sequence prediction via Bayesian transfer learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,There is almost certainly individual variability between the training sequences (for which explanatory variables not be available in the inputs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,The Bayesian approach gives a natural approach to performing transfer and handling low data regimes (common in all experiments).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,The Bayesian formulation creates a computational challenge (the posterior becomes intractable).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,The proposed BMM approximation is both reasonable and relatively novel (particularly given the popularity of MCMC and variational methods).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByqiJIqxg,"With the caveat that I am not well-versed in recent work on Bayesian moment matching, a cursory literature search suggests this is a novel application of BMM.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,Summary of the paper,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,The paper studies the invertiblity of convolutional neural network in the random model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,A reconstruction algorithm similar to IHT is proposed for layer-wise inversion of the network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,Clarity:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,The paper is confusing wrt to standard notations in deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"The paper makes two simplifications in the analysis of a CNN, that makes it map to a model based compressive sensing framework:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,1-  The non linearity (RELU) is dropped.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"This is a big simplification, for random gaussian weights for instance we know by JL that we can preserve L_2 distance, when RELU is applied the metric changes (see for instance the kernel for n=1 in  http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~saul/papers/nips09_kernel.pdf).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"2- The pooling operation is modified to be shrinkage operator, that keeps the maximum value in a block  and sets to the zero other values, hence the dimensionality of the pooled representation is the same of the un-pooled representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,Note that in that cases the locations of where the maximum happens is known.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,This is not the case in the ’standard’ max pooling definition.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,IHT does not map to a forward of a CNN as described in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,(see next point),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,3- It maybe that the notations  used in the paper are implying some confusions wrt to the standard notations in deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,- Let z be the standard  pooled representation of dimension ‘k’.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"- Define U as the unpooling  operation U(z, locations of maximum) :=  M(Wx,k).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,Hence your model of inversion is assuming the knowledge of the ’standard’ pooling representation and the switches (max locations).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"Referring to M as a pooling operation is misleading and confusing, it is the ‘standard’ unpooling operation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"- Under this notations W^{\top} U(z, locations of maximum) is a sensible reconstruction algorithm , with the simplification of ignoring the RELU.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"Under these notations,  IHT is similar to a backward of the encoding neural network not  a forward.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"It is known if you take the derivative with respect to the input in a neural network, you get the transpose convolution also known as ‘deconvolution’ (which is not a correct naming) , hence this IHT iteration is nothing else then the well known transposed convolution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mAJI9gl,"4- I suggest the authors to rewrite the paper taking into account standard definitions and notation in deep learning as discussed in point 3, and to clearly state that the recovery is done under the knowledge of the switches.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"1. The hierarchical memory is fixed, not learned, and there is no hierarchical in the experimental section, only one layer for softmax layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"2. It shows the 10-mips > 100-mips > 1000-mips, does it mean 1-mips is the best one we should adopt?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,3. Approximated k-mips is worse than even original method. Why does it need exact k-mips? It seems the proposed method is not robust.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The paper proposes an algorithm for training memory networks which have very large memories.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"Training such models in traditional ways, by using soft-attention mechanism over all the memory slots is not only slow, it is also harder to train due to dispersion of gradients.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The paper proposes to use the k-mips algorithm over the memories to choose a subset of the memory slots over which the attention is applied.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"Since the cost of exact k-mips is the same as doing full attention, the authors propose to use approximate k-mips, which while faster to compute, results in inferior performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,An artifact of using k-mips is that one cannot learn the memory slots.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,Hence they are pre-trained and kept fixed during entire training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The experimental section shows the efficacy of using k-mips using the SimpleQuestions dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The exact k-mips results in the same performance as the full attention.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The approximate k-mips results in deterioration in performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The paper is quite clearly written and easy to understand.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,I think the ideas proposed in the paper are not super convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,I have a number of issues with this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"1. The k-mips algorithm forces the memories to be fixed. This to me is a rather limiting constraint, especially on problems/dataset which will require multiple hops of training to do compounded reasoning. As a results I'm not entirely sure about the usefulness of this technique.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"2. Furthermore, the exact k-mips is the sample complexity as the full attention. The only way to achieve speedup is to use approx k-mips. That, as expected, results in a significant drop in performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"3. The paper motivates the ideas by proposing solutions to eliminate heuristics used to prune the memories. However in Section 3.1 the authors themselves end up using multiple heuristics to make the training work. Agreed, that the used heuristics are not data dependent, but still, it feels like they are kicking the can down the road as far as heuristics are concerned.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"4. The experimental results are not very convincing. First there is no speed comparison. Second, the authors do not compare with methods other than k-mips which do fast nearest neighbor search, such as, FLANN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,I find this paper not very compelling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,The basic idea seems to be that we can put a fast neighbor searcher into a memory augmented net to make the memory lookups scalable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"However, this was precisely the point of Rae et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,There are a  number of standardized neighbor searchers; I don't understand why the authors choose to use their own (which they do not benchmark against the standards).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"Moreover, they test on a problem where there is no clear need for (vector based) fast-nn, because one can use hashing on the text.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ0Ee8cxx,"I also find the repeated distinction between ""mips"" and ""nns"" distracting; most libraries that can do one can do the other, or inputs can be modified  to switch between the problems; indeed the authors do this when they convert to the  ""mcss"" problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"The paper introduces the joint multimodal variational autoencoder, a directed graphical model for modeling multimodal data with latent variable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,the model is rather straightforward extension of standard VAE where two data modalities are generated from a shared latent representation independently.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,In order to deal with missing input modalities or bi-directional inference between two modalities the paper introduces modality-specific encoder that is trained to minimize the KL divergence of latent variable distributions between joint and modality-specific recognition networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"The paper demonstrates its effectiveness on MNIST and CelebA datasets, both in terms of test log-likelihoods and the conditional image generation and editing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The proposed method is rather straightforward extension of VAE and therefore the model should inherent the probabilistic inference methods of VAE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"For example, for missing data modalities, the model should be able to infer joint representation as well as filling in the missing modalities via iterative sampling as introduced by Rezende et al. (2014).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"Given marginal improvement, I am not convinced by the contribution of modality-specific encoders in Section 3.3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"In addition, the inference methods introduced for generating Figure 5 looks somewhat unprincipled; I am wondering the conditional image generation results by following more principled approach (e.g., iterative sampling).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,Experimental results on joint image-attribute generation is also missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The proposed method of modeling multimodal datasets is a VAE with an inference network for every combination of missing and present modalities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The method is evaluated on modeling MNIST and CelebA datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,MNIST is hardly a multimodal dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The authors propose to use the labels as a separate modality that gets modeled with a variational autoencoder.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The reviewer finds this choice perplexing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"Even then the modalities are never actually missing, so the applicability of the suggested method is questionable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"In addition the differences in log-likelihoods between different models are tiny, and likely to be due to noise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The other experiment reports log-likelihood of models that were not trained to maximize log-likelihood.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,It is not clear what conclusions can be drawn from such comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,This paper proposes an alternative to Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders and Conditional MultiModal Auto-Encoders to perform inference of missing modalities in dataset with multiple modalities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The proposed approach is a Variational Auto-Encoder jointly on all the modalities  with additional KL divergence penalties between the approximate posterior given all the modalities and the approximate posterior given a subset of the modalities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The approach is named Joint Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The authors make a connection between this approach and the Variation of Information.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,It is unclear why the authors chose the JMVAE approach instead of a more elegant Variation of Information approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,Another unaddressed issue is the scalability of the method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"As far as I can tell (given that no code is provided and the specification of the encoder is missing), this approach requires a new encoder per subset of missing modalities.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,Right now this approach seems to scale since there are only two modalities.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,The fact that the estimating the log-likelihood log(p(x)) using multiple modalities provide a lower value than with just one in Table 1 is a bit odd.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,Could you explain that ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"The comparison with between the representation learned by JMVAE and CVAE might be unfair given that the representation of CVAE is learned conditionally, on the label in the case of MNIST, and should therefore not consider the label in this representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"Intuitively, this representation could represent ""style"" as shown in (Kingma et al., 2014) in their conditional generation figure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"For CelebA, comparing log-likelihood on models that use GANs is probably not significant since GAN does not optimizes log-likelihood.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk8rlUqge,"Overall this is an interesting problem and there are also interesting ideas worth exploring further, but the execution of the paper requires more work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The paper presents a theoretically well motivated for visualizing what parts of the input feature map are responsible for the output decision.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The key insight is that features that maximally change the output and are simultaneously more unpredictable from other features are the most important ones.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Most previous work has focused on finding features that maximally change the output without accounting for their predictability from other features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Authors build upon ideas presented in the work of Robnik-Šikonja & Kononenko (2008).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The results indicate that the proposed visualization mechanism based on modeling conditional distribution identifies more salient regions as compared to a mechanism based on modeling marginal distribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,I like that authors have presented visualization results for a single image across multiple networks and multiple classes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,There results show that the proposed method indeed picks up on class-discriminative features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Authors have provided a link to visualizations for a random sample of images in a comment – I encourage the authors to include this in the appendix of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"My one concern with the paper is – Zeiler et al., proposed a visualization method by greying small square regions in the image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,This is similar to computing the visualization using the marginal distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"Authors compute the marginal visualization using 10 samples, however in the limit of infinite samples the image region would be gray.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The conditional distribution is computed using a normal distribution that provides some regularization and therefore estimating the conditional and marginal distributions using 10 samples each is not justified.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,I would like to see the comparison when grey image patches (akin to Zeiler et al.) are used for visualization against the approach based on the conditional distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The authors propose a way to visualize which areas of an image provide mostly influence a certain DNN response mostly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"They apply some very elegant and convincing improvements to the basic method by Robnik-Sikonja and Konononko from 2008 to DNNs, thus improving it's analysis and making it usable for images and DNNs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The authors provide a very thorough analysis of their methods and show very convincing examples (which they however handpicked.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,It would be very nice to have maybe at least one figure showing the analysis on e.g. 24 random picks from ImageNet).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,One thing I would like to see is how their method compares to some other methods they mention in the introduction (like gradient-based ones or deconvolution based ones).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"They paper is very clearly written, all necessary details are given and the paper is very nice to read.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Alltogether: The problem of understanding how DNNs function and how they draw their conclusions is discussed a lot.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"The author's method provides a clear contribution that can lead to further progress in this field (E.g. I like figure 8 showing how AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG differ in where they collect evidence from).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,I can think of several potential applications of the method and therefore consider it of high significance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Update: The authors did a great job of adopting all of my suggestions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,Therefore I improve the rating from 8 to 9.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The authors of this work propose an interesting approach to visualizing the predictions made by a deep neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,The manuscript is well written is provides good insight into the problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"I also appreciate the application to medical images, as simply illustrating the point on ImageNet isn't interesting enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,I do have some questions and comments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"1.  As the authors correctly point out in 3.1, approximating the conditional probability of a feature x_i by the marginal distribution p(x_i) is not realistic. They advocate for translation invariance, i.e. the position of the pixel in the image shouldn't affect the probability, and suggest that the pixels appearance depends on the small neighborhood around it. However, it is well known that global context makes an big impact on the semantics of pixels. In ""Objects in Contexts"", authors show that a given neighborhood of pixels can take different semantic meanings based on the global context in the image. In the context of deep neural networks, works such as ""ParseNet"" also illustrate the importance of global context on the spatial label distribution. This does not necessarily invalidate this approach, but is a significant limitation. It would be great if the authors provided a modification to (4) and empirically verified the change.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,2. Figure 7 shows the distribution over top 3 predictions before and after softmax. It is expected that even fairly uniform distributions will transform toward delta functions after softmax normalization. Is there an additional insight here?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ5UeU9xx,"4. Finally, in 4.1, the authors state that it takes 30 minutes to analyze a single image with GooLeNet on a GPU? Why is this so computationally expensive? Such complexity seems to make the algorithm impractical and analyzing datasets of statistical relevance seems prohibitive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"The paper proposes a new neural architecture, called DRAGNN, for the transition-based framework.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,A DRAGNN uses TBRUs which are neural units to compute hidden activations for the current state of a transition-based system.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,The paper proves that DRAGNNs can cover a wide range of transition-based methods in the literature.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"Regarding to the first part, the proposed DRAGNN is a neat tool for building any transition-based systems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"However, it is difficult to say whether the DRAGNN is novel.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"However, we should bear in mind that the solutions employed are already there in the literature, thus making difficult to judge the novelty of this part w.r.t.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"The framework defines a new, general-purpose recurrent unit called the TBRU, which takes a transition system, defining and constraining its inputs and outputs, and input function which defines the mapping between raw inputs and fixed-width vector representations, and recurrence function that defines the inputs to each recurrent step as a function of the current state, and an RNN cell that computes the output from the input (fixed and recurrent).",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"In particular, this paper explores the application of these dynamic connections to syntactic dependency parsing, both as a standalone task, and by multitasking parsing with extractive summarization, using the same compositional phrase representations as features for the parser and summarization (previous work used discrete parse features), which is particularly simple/elegant in this framework.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"In experimental results, the authors demonstrate that such multitasking leads to more accurate summarization models, and using the framework to incorporate more structure into existing parsing models also leads to increased accuracy with no big-oh efficiency loss (compared with e.g. attention).",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BycCx8qex,"This is the most important contribution, but it gets lost in the description and presentation as a framework — emphasizing that attention, seq2seq, etc can be represented in the framework is distracting and makes it seem less novel than it is.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,Approach:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,Could this approach be combined with other state representation learning approaches?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,e.g. approaches that use an autoencoder.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,Experiments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,"One additional useful comparison would be to evaluate performance in the single-task setting (e.g. only controlling the red car), as an upper bound on how well the policy should be able to perform.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,Does the learned multi-task policy reach the same level of performance?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,This upper bound will be tighter than the “known car position” baseline (which is also useful in its own right).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,Does the “observations” baseline eventually reach the performance of the LRP approach?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,It would be useful to know if this approach simply speeds up learning (significantly) or if it enables better performance.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,there were several unclear issues:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,"1. The first question is that if the method is only appealing on the scenario like the slot-car racing, otherwise it should be benchmarked with mutli-task learning. While the author made the argument in the related work, the proposed method is orthogonal to multi-task learning they did admit both explore shared knowledge between tasks. What's the advantage and disadvantage for the proposed method for general mutiple task setting, in particular over the multi-task learning?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,The reply of the authors was not fully satisfactory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,The argument did not support the lack of comparison to multi-task joint-learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,It seems they don't plan to include any comparison neither.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,"I think it's important for the fundamental motivation for the work, without such comparison, the method seems to be purely an alternative to multi-task joint-learning without any(or much) practical advantage.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,"2.Following up to the previous question, please clarify the results on the mobile navigation scenario.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1aGWUqgg,"It's not clear how the plot on the right indicates MT-LRP identifies all tasks as the author claimed and and seems very weak to support the method, in particular compared to the multi-slot car-racing driving experiment, there is too little results to make sound argument (almost no comparison to alternative methods, i.e. no baseline method, is that true for the problem).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,This paper and links to the work here ought to be discussed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,2),1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,is probably the correct paper to cite for learning multilingual word embeddings from multilingual aligned data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,3) It would have been nicer if experiments had been performed with more divergent language pairs rather than just European/Romance languages,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,4),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,A lot of the argumentation around the orthogonality requirements feels related to the idea of using a Mahalanobis distance / covar matrix to learn such mappings.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,"5) I don't have a better suggestion, but is there an alternative to using the term ""translation (performance/etc.)"" when discussing word alignment across languages?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,Translation implies something more complex than this in my mind.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,I have few more comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,1. Header for table 3 which says “word frequency” is misleading. “word frequency” could mean that rare words occur in row-1 while I guess authors meant to say that rare words occur in row-5.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,2. I see that authors have removed precision @5 and @10 from table-6. Is it because of the space constraints or the results have different trend? I would like to see these results in the appendix.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,3. In table-6 what is the difference between row-3 and row-4? Is the only difference NN vs. inverted softmax? Or there are other differences? Please elaborate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,4. Another suggestion is to try running an additional experiment where one can use both expert dictionary and cognate dictionary. Comparing all 3 methods in this setting should give more valuable insights about the usefulness of cognate dictionary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,This paper extends preceding works to create a mapping between the word embedding space of two languages.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,"The word embeddings had been independently trained on monolingual data only, and various forms of bilingual information is used to learn the mapping.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,This mapping is then used to measure the precision of translations.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,Could you make clear in what aspect your work is different from Faruqui & Dyer 2014 (other the fact that you applied the method to measure translation precision) ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,Using cognates instead of a bilingual directory is a nice trick.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,"Also, it seems to me that in linguistics the term ""cognate"" refers to words which have a common etymological origin - they don't necessarily have the same written form (e.g. night, nuit, noche, Nacht).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,"Maybe, you should use a different term ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Aab85gg,Those words are probably proper names in news texts.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl,If the learned,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"I agree with the authors that this paper differs from how shaping typically works (by modifying the problem itself) because in their implementation the architecture is what is ""shaped"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"Nevertheless, the central idea in both cases is to solve a series of optimization problems of increasing difficulty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"Therefore, I strongly suggest including a discussion of the differences between shaping, curriculum learning (I'm also not sure how this is different from shaping), and the present approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,The presentation of the method for neural networks lacks clarity in presentation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Improving this presentation will make this paper much easier to digest.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,In particular:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Alg. 1 can not be understood at the point that it is referenced.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Please explain the steps to Eq. 25 more clearly and connect to steps 1-6 in Alg. 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Define u(x) clearly before defining u*(x),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,There are several concerns with the experimental evaluations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"There should be a discussion about why doesn't the method work for solving much more challenging network training problems, such as thin and deep networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Some specific concerns:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,The MLPs trained (Parity and Pentomino) are not very deep at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,An experiment of training thin networks with systematically increasing depth would be a better fit to test this method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Network depth is well known to pose optimization challenges.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"Instead, it is stated without reference that ""Learning the mapping from sequences of characters to the word-embeddings is a difficult problem.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"For cases where the gain is primarily due to the regularization effect, this method should be compared to other weight noise regularization methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"I also suggest comparing to highway networks, since there are thematic similarities in Eq. 22, and it is possible that they can automatically anneal their behavior from simple to complex nets during training, considering that they are typically initialized with a bias towards copying behavior.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"For CIFAR-10 experiment, does the mollified model also use Residual connections?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"If so, why?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"In either case, why does the mollified net actually train slower than the residual and stochastic depth networks?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,This is inconsistent with the MLP results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"Overall, the ideas and developments in this paper are promising, but it needs more work to be a clear accept for me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,The authors show that the idea of smoothing a highly non-convex loss function can make deep neural networks easier to train.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"The paper is well-written, the idea is carefully analyzed, and the experiments are convincing, so we recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"For a stronger recommendation, it would be valuable to perform more experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"In particular, how does your smoothing technique compare to inserting probes in various layers of the network?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,Another interesting question would be how it performs on hard-to-optimize tasks such as algorithm learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,"For example, in the ""Neural GPU Learns Algorithms"" paper the authors had to relax the weights of different layers of their RNN to make it optimize",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1G4z8cge,could this be avoided with your smoothing technique?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,This work brings multiple discriminators into GAN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"From the result, multiple discriminators is useful for stabilizing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"The main problem of stabilizing seems is from gradient signal from discriminator, the authors motivation is using multiple discriminators to reduce this effect.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"I think this work indicates the direction is promising, however I think the authors may consider to add more result vs approach which enforce discriminator gradient, such as GAN with DAE (Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching), to show advantages of multiple discriminators.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The paper extends the GAN framework to accommodate multiple discriminators.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The authors motivate this from two points of view:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"(1) Having multiple discriminators tackle the task is equivalent to optimizing the value function using random restarts, which can potentially help optimization given the nonconvexity of the value function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,(2) Having multiple discriminators can help overcome the optimization problems arising when a discriminator is too harsh a critic.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,A generator receiving signal from multiple discriminators is less likely to be receiving poor gradient signal from all discriminators.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The paper's main idea looks straightforward to implement in practice and makes for a good addition to the GAN training toolbelt.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,I am not very convinced by the GAM (and by extension the GMAM) evaluation metric.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"Without evidence that the GAN game is converging (even approximately), it is hard to make the case that the discriminators tell something meaningful about the generators with respect to the data distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"In particular, it does not inform on mode coverage or probability mass misallocation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The learning curves (Figure 3) look more convincing to me: they provide good evidence that increasing the number of discriminators has a stabilizing effect on the learning dynamics.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"However, it seems like this figure along with Figure 4 also show that the unmodified generator objective is more stable even with only one discriminator.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"In that case, is it even necessary to have more than one discriminator to train the generator using an unmodified objective?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"Overall, I think the ideas presented in this paper show good potential, but I would like to see an extended analysis in the line of Figures 3 and 4 for more datasets before I think it is ready for publication.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,UPDATE:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The rating has been revised to a 7 following discussion with the authors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,In this interesting paper the authors explore the idea of using an ensemble of multiple discriminators in generative adversarial network training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"This comes with a number of benefits, mainly being able to use less powerful discriminators which may provide better training signal to the generator early on in training when strong discriminators might overpower the generator.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,My main comment is about the way the paper is presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,The caption of Figure 1. and Section 3.1 suggests using the best discriminator by taking the maximum over the performance of individual ensemble members.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,This does not appear to be the best thing to do because we are just bound to get a training signal that is stricter than any of the individual members of the ensemble.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,Then the rest of the paper explores relaxing the maximum and considers various averaging techniques to obtain a ’soft-discriminator’.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"To me, this idea is far more appealing, and the results seem to support this, too.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"Skimming the paper it seems as if the authors mainly advocated always using the strongest discriminator, evidenced by my premature pre-review question earlier.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byk-VI9eg,"Overall, I think this paper is a valuable contribution, and I think the idea of multiple discriminators is an interesting direction to pursue.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In this paper, the authors study the problem of discovering options for reinforcement learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"They introduce the Bi-POMDP model, which is a POMDP where the observations are structured as a pair of elements, with the first element only available to the option-choosing component (the ""option level"") and the second element only to the action-choosing component (the ""action level"") and the termination component (the ""acquisition model"").",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"They also detail the BONN learning model, which consists of three artificial neural network that implement these three components.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Finally, they suggest optimizing a tradeoff between the value achieved by the model and the cost of switching between options (the ""cognitive effort""), and demonstrate this approach in three simple domains: Cart-Pole, Lunar Lander and two variants of a grid-world maze.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The paper is interesting, and adds considerably to the increasing body of research in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"I found no critical flaws in the paper, but also no high-impact insights or impressive improvements.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"This paper offers some good ideas that are moderately novel and may advance the field, but has some issues.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The first issue is that it is unclear how much easier it is to compose Bi-POMDPs than hand-crafted options or subgoals.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"If Bi-POMDPs are to alleviate the design costs of using HRL with human-defined structure, one needs to show that the splitting of observations into two elements (x, y) is easier to do well enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"For example, in Section 5 the authors are correct in pointing out that sequences of actions (""macro-actions"") are open-loop, and therefore not as expressive as closed-loop options.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"However, by setting x empty in all but one experiment, the authors also restrict themselves to open-loop sub-policies, albeit stochastic ones.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Such sub-policies may be sufficiently expressive for the simple domains in this paper, but this is unlikely so in more realistic domains.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In the MAZE_2 domain, x is the agent's position relative to the current room.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Designing this domain-specific observation model requires domain knowledge, arguably no less than designing relevant subgoals.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"It is hard to judge the effectiveness of this approach without design principles for these domain-specific observation models, and more realistic experiments to evaluate their quality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Finally, it is revealing that the drive for hierarchy is only achieved by limiting x.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In Section 3.3 the authors mention that acquisition of y is ""crucial for discovering a good policy: an agent only using the observations x_t would be unable to solve the task"", which suggests that the design choice of x directly impacts one side of the trade-off between the value and the cognitive effort.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,Such an important factor should be addressed explicitly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The authors may be interested in the paper ""Learning and Transfer of Modulated Locomotor Controllers"" (Heess et al., 2016), which has a similar split observation model, and suffers from the same issue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The second issue is that the option space seems to be expressive enough to represent y with high fidelity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"If this is the case, and if the learned option model indeed maintains a good image of y, then the algorithm is really solving a different problem: reinforcement learning with costly observability of y.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,This means that it learns how to act given a stale value of y and when to refresh it.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,It should then be framed accordingly and compared with the relevant literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,It may or may not be as interesting or novel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In contrast, the standard options framework calls for compression of y into the choice of option o (usually in a small finite space).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The agent should learn to extract subtask-relevant information from y, in a way that generalizes to unseen states or subtasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"That said, the embedding of y in the option space can be interesting in itself, even if it is lossless (1-to-1).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Unfortunately, no such analysis was offered by the authors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,Minor issues:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In 3.3: error in citation, (?) appears instead.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In 4.1: it is confusing to say that ""the environments are more stochastic"" when epsilon is increased.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"It is the agent's policy, not the environment, that becomes more stochastic, which is useful for exploration.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"If this hurts performance, some discussion is needed of why too much exploration is detrimental to learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In particular, the paper does not make explicit the number of iterations in the experiments, and it is not clear whether learning with larger epsilon is worse after some fixed number of iterations or asymptotically.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The paper presents an approach to constructing hierarchical RL representations which relies on assuming agents that need to spend cognitive effort in order to choose their actions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The paper p[roposes a specific way of formulating option construction via what they call a ""Bi-POMDP"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"This idea is potentially very interesting, plausible form a cognitive science point of view, and definitely deserves attention.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"However, there are some problems which do not make the paper acceptable in its current form.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,I am listing them here in order of importance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"1. It is not clear from the description why a Bi-POMDP is not a POMDP. POMDPs allow for vector-based observations.  Suppose the observation vector is (x_t, \sigma_t * y_t). This seems like it would result in a POMDP which is identical to the proposed model. The paper should include an example of a Bi-POMDP which is *not* a POMDP, or be revised to use specific POMDP terminology (see eg the use of augmented MDPs in hierarchical RL, which *are MDPs* but do not work in the original state space)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"2. The paper make some specific assumptions about the abstractions (eg determinism in certain places). It is not clear why these are needed at all. Similarly, there are some very specific assumptions regarding the form of the approximations used (Relu, GRUs etc).  Are these necessary? In principle one could implement the ideas in the paper with other, simpler architectures. Was this the first set of choices, or was it arrived at after some experimentation? It is important to understand how much of the performance achieved is due to the specific (fairly powerful) architectures and what one could get through simpler means (eg, feedforward nets)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"3. The paper seems quite similar in spirit to Bacon & Precup, 2015b; in fact, it seems that the use of a value function or model that they discuss is a way to provide a y_t. However, there is no direct comparison to that approach. Since it is very related, it would be useful to perform some of those same experiments. Also, their paper works entirely in the MDP, not POMDP framework, so some clarification is needed here regarding the use of POMDPs instead.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"4. The choice of domains is somewhat limited to simple tasks, while some of the recent approaches in hierarchical RL use more complex domains (Atari, Minecraft etc). Ideally, the experiments should be extended to some of these more complex tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"5. What are the theoretical properties of the proposed approach? Eg, is the proposed algorithm convergent? If Bi-POMDP is a POMDP, then one should be able to leverage POMDP results to build some theory here. If it is not a POMDP, then we need some understanding of how easy/hard a Bi-POMDP is to solve",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"6. The paper contains many grammar problems and some broken references, and should be proof-read thoroughly",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In summary, while the proposed approach is quite interesting and definitely worth exploring, the paper is not ready for publication in its current form.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,This paper proposes an approach to learning hierarchical actions or options in reinforcement learning using the so-called BONN model (for budgeted options with neural networks).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The approach is an interesting mixture of the old and the new.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Some ideas seem very related to previous work in the literature, such as variants of hidden Markov models proposed by Hung Bui and others (abstract HMM, hierarchical POMDP by Theocharous et al., IROS 2005; Murphy et al., NIPS, ICRA).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The major difference is that unlike the prior work using a graphical model, this paper uses a gated recurrent network neural model to implement the learning of options from data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The approach is based on minimizing some quantity called the ""cognitive effort"", but this is confusingly explained, and not very precise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The basic idea here is to define a budget that modified the immediate reward, and so its minimization is viewed as minimizing cognitive effort.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The approach seems a bit ad hoc.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,Experiments are reported on a variety of simple discrete and continuous control benchmark domains.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The paper tackles the very important problem of learning options from data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The introduction of the budget constraint is an interesting twist on this problem, which I had not seen before (though other methods apply other constraints.)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"I must say I’m not very convinced by the need to introduce the Bi-POMDP framework, where the conventional POMDP framework would do.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In discussions, the authors suggest this makes for simpler comparison with RL models, but I find that it rather obscures the link to POMDP models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The proposed method makes an interesting contribution, distinct from the existing literature as far as I know.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,The extension to discover a discrete set of options is a nice feature for practical applications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"In terms of the algorithm itself, I am actually unclear about lines 4 & 6.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"At line 4, I don’t know how \sigma_t is computed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,Can you give the precise equation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"At line 6, I don’t know how the new option o_t is generated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"Again, can you give the precise procedure?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"The paper contains several empirical results, on contrasting simulated domains.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eLE8qlx,"For some of these domains, such as CartPole, it’s really not clear that options are necessary.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Such smoothing idea is not new, but was not investigated previously in wide range of machine learning tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"The paper should report the state-of-the-art results for speech recognition tasks (TIMIT, WSJ), even if models are not directly comparable.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Is there an efficient solution for BP of the entropy smoothing through softmax?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Although the classification accuracy could remain the same, the model will not estimate the true posterior distribution with this kind of smoothing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"This might be an issue in complex machine learning problems where the decision is made on higher level and based on the posterior estimations, e.g. language models in speech recognition.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,More motivation is necessary for the proposed smoothing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Specifically, this paper suggests regularizing the estimator of a probability distribution to prefer high-entropy distributions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,This avoids overfitting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,I generally like this idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Regularizing the behavior of the model often makes more sense than regularizing its parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"After all, the behavior is interpretable, whereas the parameters are uninterpretable and work together in mysterious ways to produce the behavior.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,So one might be able to choose a more sensible prior over the behavior.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"In other words, prefer parameters not because they are individually close to 0",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,but because they jointly lead to a distribution that is plausible or low-risk a priori.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Pro: I believe that the idea is natural and sound (that is, I do not share the doubts of AnonReviewer5).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Pro: It's possible that this hasn't been well-explored yet in neural networks (not sure).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Pro: The experimental results look good.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,So maybe everyone should use this kind of regularizer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Con: It is a kind of pollution of the scientific literature to introduce this idea to the community as if it were unconnected to (almost) anything else in machine learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"There are many, many papers that include a scaled entropy term in the optimization objective!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,It's not just for reinforcement learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,Please see the long list of connections in my pre-review questions / comments.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Summary recommendation: Revise and resubmit.  ICLR has lots of submissions.  I would prefer to reward authors who not only tried something, but who properly contextualized it and carefully evaluated it.  Otherwise, there's a race to the bottom where everyone wants to be the first to try something, so that readers are confronted with a confusing sea of slapdash papers with unclear relationships.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,The authors propose a simple idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,They penalize confident predictions by using the entropy of the predictive distribution as a regularizer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,The authors consider two variations on this idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"In one, they penalize the divergence from the uniform distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"In the other variation, they penalize distance from the base rates.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"They term this variation ""unigram"" but I find the name odd as I've never seen multi-class labels described as unigrams before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,What would a bigram be?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"The idea is simple,  and while it's been used in the context of reinforcement learning, it hasn't been popularized as a regularizer for improving generalization in supervised learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,The justifications for the idea still lacks analysis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,And the author responses comparing it to L2 regularization have some holes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,A simple number line example with polynomial regression makes clear how L2 regularization could prevent a model from badly overfitting to accommodate every data point.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"In contrast, it seems trivial to fit every data point and satisfy arbitrarily high entropy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Of course, the un-regularized optimization is to maximize log likelihood, not simply to maximize accuracy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,And perhaps something interesting may be happening at the interplay between the log likelihood objective and the regularization objective.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,But the paper doesn't indicate precisely what.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"I could imagine the following scenario: when the network outputs probabilities near 0, it can get high loss (if the label is 1).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"The entropy regularization could be stabilizing the gradient, preventing sharp loss on outlier examples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,The regularization then might owe mainly to faster convergence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkCjNI5ex,"Could the authors analyze the effect empirically, on the distribution of the gradient norms?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyTqHL5xg,Section 2.2 last paragraph: “A key contribution is […] forcing the latent space to fit the transition”.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,=== Experiments ===,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"Since the authors are experimenting w/ seq2seq architectures, its a little bit disappointing they didn't compare it w/ Machine Translation (MT), where there are many published papers to compare to.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The authors did compare their method on several toy datasets (that are less commonly used in DL literature) and MNIST/CIFAR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The authors show improvement over their own baselines on several toy datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The improvement on MNIST/CIFAR over the author's baseline seems marginal at best.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,here they have a much better LSTM baseline of 25% for CIFAR which beats the author's baseline of 32.35% and the author's method of 31.93%.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The experiments would be much more convincing if they did it on seq2seq+MT on say EN-FR or EN-DE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"There is almost no excuse why the experiments wasn't run on the MT task, given this is the first application of seq2seq was born from.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,One comments of the comparison is the use of a simple 2-layer MLP as the baseline model throughout all the tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,It's not clear whether the gains maintain when a more complex baseline model is used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"Another comment is that the augmented context vectors are used for classification, just wondering how does it compare to using the reconstructed inputs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"And furthermore, as in Table 4, both input and feature space extrapolation improves the performance, whether these two are complementary or not?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"In this paper authors propose a novel data augmentation scheme where instead of augmenting the input data, they augment intermediate feature representations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"Sequence auto-encoder based features are considered, and random perturbation, feature interpolation, and extrapolation based augmentation are evaluated.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,authors baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,My main questions and suggestions for further strengthening the paper are:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,a),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The proposed data augmentation approach is applied to a learnt auto-encoder based feature space termed ‘context vector’ in the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The context vectors are then augmented and used as input to train classification models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"Have the authors considered applying their feature space augmentation idea directly to the classification model during training, and applying it to potentially many layers of the model?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"Also, have the authors considered convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures as well for feature space augmentation?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"CNNs are now the state-of-the-art in many image and sequence classification task, it would be very valuable to see the impact of the proposed approach in that model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"b) When interpolation or extrapolation based augmentation was being applied, did the authors also consider utilizing nearby samples from competing classes as well?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,Especially in case of extrapolation based augmentation it will be interesting to check if the extrapolated features are closer to competing classes than original ones.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,c),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,With random interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation based augmentation the accuracy seems to degrade pretty consistently.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,This is counter-intuitive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,Do the authors have explanation for why the accuracy degraded with interpolation based augmentation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,d),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,The results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are inconclusive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"For instance the error rate on CIFAR-10 is well below 10% these days, so I think it is hard to draw conclusions based on error rates above 30%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,For MNIST it is surprising to see that data augmentation in the input space substantially degrades the accuracy (1.093% -> 1.477%).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ9rLLcxg,"As mentioned above, I think this will require extending the feature space augmentation idea to CNN based models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,The authors introduce an adaptive softmax approximation tailored for faster performance on GPUs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"The key idea, which is very sensible, is to use a class-based hierarchical softmax, but where the clusters/hierarchy are distributed such that the resulting matrix multiplications are optimally-sized for GPU computation, based on their empirical tests.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,Their results indicate that the system does indeed work very well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"In terms of presentation, I found the paper to have both clear and unclear elements.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Fortunately, the underlying concepts and logic seem quite clear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Unfortunately, at various points, the writing is not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"There are various minor typos (as mentioned by AnonReviewer2, in addition to some other spots, e.g. the notation describing recurrent network in Section 3 mentions an x_t which is surely different from the x_t used in the previous paragraph on regular feedforward NN's, i think it belonged in the equation for h_t; the use of the two matrices A and P in Eq2 is strange, etc).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Also, while Section 4.2 (Intuition for 2-cluster case) was a good idea to include and helpful, and while the *concepts* underlying the complexity analysis were straightforward, it could be made a lot clearer by (a) adding an additional figure such as Figure 2, along with (b) a few well-placed additional sentences unpacking the logic of the argument into easier-to-follow steps.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"For example, it was only when I saw Eq (6) and (7) combined with Fig(2) that the analysis on the previous page made more sense in terms of arriving at the eq for the complexity of putting the head of the distribution in the root of the tree.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,(Perhaps an Appendix might be the most appropriate place to add such an explanation).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,SYNOPSIS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,The authors introduce an efficient approximation to the softmax function that speeds up the empirical calculation of the softmax on GPUs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,They leverage the unbalanced distribution of words and specific empirical timings of matrix multiplies on GPUs to devise an algorithm that selects an optimal placement of the vocabulary into clusters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"They show empirical results that show speedups over alternative methods, while not losing much accuracy compared to the full softmax.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,THOUGHTS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Since the goal of this work is to speed up training, I'm curious why you compare only to the flat 2-level HSM (O(sqrt(V)) speedup at best), and not the deeper binary-tree HSM (O(lgV) speedup at best)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Overall, the paper is clear, easy to understand, and well written, bar a few notation issues as pointed out by other reviewers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,It adds an interesting extra tool in the language modeling toolbox.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,The idea is based on several previous works that aim to optimize vocabulary clustering to improve the speed-accuracy tradeoff often experienced in practice with hierarchical methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"The interesting result here seems to be that this particular clustering objective improves speed (what it was designed for), while apparently not losing much i.t.o. accuracy (what it wasn't designed for).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"Although the authors do not speculate  reasons for the latter part at all, I suspect it is largely related to the fact that the flat region on the timing graph (Fig 1) means that the head group V_h can actually include a sizeable portion of the most frequent words in the vocabulary at constant cost.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"This reduces the approximation error (regions of no support in P_approx(next | previous) compared to P_real ), which in turn mitigates the hit in perplexity compared to the full softmax.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"However, since the method is intimately related to the speed-optimal method proposed by Zweig et al. (2013) (albeit without the explicit tailoring towards GPU), I feel that a direct comparison is warranted (I understand this is underway).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"If the performance and accuracy improvements still hold, I will update my rating to a 7.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,"he authors provide an interesting, computational-complexity-driven approach for efficient softmax computation for language modeling based on GPUs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkmDI85ge,An adaptive softmax approach is proposed based on a hierarchical model.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,This paper addresses the problem of data sparsity in the healthcare domain by leveraging hierarchies of medical concepts organized in ontologies.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The paper focuses on sequential prediction given a patient’s medical record (a sequence of medical codes, some of which might occur very rarely).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Instead of simply assigning each medical code an independent embedding before feeding it to an RNN, the proposed approach assigns each node in the medical ontology a “basic” embedding, and composes a “final” embedding for each medical code by taking a learned weighted average (via an attention mechanism) of the medical code’s ancestors in the ontology.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Notably, the paper is well written and the approach is quite intuitive.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,I have the following comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Why is the patient’s visit taken as just the sum of medical codes found in the visit, and not say the average or a learned weighted average?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,Wouldn’t this bias for/against the number of codes in the visit?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,I don’t see why basic embeddings are not fine tuned as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,Did you find that to hurt performance?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,Do you have an explanation for that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Looking at Figure 2, the results seem very close and the figures are not very clear (figure (b) top is missing).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Also, I am wondering how significant the differences are so it would be nice to comment on that.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Finally, I think this is an interesting application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,The paper deals with an important issue that arises when applying deep learning models in domains with scarce data resources.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"However, I would like the authors to comment on what there paper offers as new insights to the ICLR community and why they think ICLR is a good avenue for their work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,I read the authors' response and maintain my rating.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"This paper introduces an approach for integrating a direct acyclic graph structure of the data into word / code embeddings, in order to leverage domain knowledge and thus help train an RNN with scarce data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,It is applied to codes of medical visits.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Each code is part of an ontology, which can be represented by a DAG, where codes correspond to leaf nodes, and where different codes may share common ancestors (non-leaf nodes) in the DAG.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Instead of embedding merely the leaf nodes, one can also embed the non-leaf nodes, and the embeddings of the code and its ancestors can be combined using a convex sum.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The attention weights depend on the embeddings and the weights of an MLP, meaning that the model can separate learning the code embeddings and the interaction between the codes.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The model is properly evaluated on two medical datasets, with several variations to isolate the contribution of the DAG (GRAM or GRAM+ vs. RNN or RandomDAG) and of pretraining the embeddings (RNN+ vs RNN, GRAM+ vs GRAM).",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The paper is also well written, and the case for MLP attention instead of a plain dot product of embeddings was made by the authors.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,My only two comments would be:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,SUMMARY.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,This paper presents a method for enriching medical concepts with their parent nodes in an ontology.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,The method employs an attention mechanism over the parent nodes of a medical concept to create a richer representation of the concept itself.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The rationale of this is that for  infrequent medical concepts the attention mechanism will rely more on general concepts, higher in the ontology hierarchy, while for frequent ones will focus on the specific concept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,The attention mechanism is trained together with a recurrent neural network and the model accuracy is tested on two tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The first task aims at prediction the diagnosis categories at each time step, while the second task aims at predicting whether or not a heart failure is likely to happen after the T-th step.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,Results shows that the proposed model works well in condition of data insufficiency.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,OVERALL JUDGMENT,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,The proposed model is simple but interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,The ideas presented are worth to expand but there are also some points where the authors could have done better.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"The learning of the representation of concepts in the ontology is a bit naive, for example the authors could have used some kind of knowledge base factorization approach to learn the concepts, or some graph convolutional approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,I do not see why the the very general factorization methods for knowledge bases do not apply in the case of ontology learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"I also found strange that the representation of leaves are fine tuned while the inner nodes are not, it is a specific reason to do so?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,"Regarding the presentation, the paper is clear and the qualitative evaluation is insightful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,DETAILED COMMENTS,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgewU5ll,Please use the same image format with the same resolution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,This paper proposes a novel and interesting way to tackle the difficulties of performing inference atop HSMM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,The idea of using an embedded bi-RNN to approximate the posterior is a reasonable and clever idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"That being said, I think two aspects may need further improvement:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,(1) An explanation as to why a bi-RNN can provide more accurate approximations than other modeling choices (e.g. structured mean field that uses a sequential model to formulate the variational distribution) is needed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,I think it would make the paper stronger if the authors can explain in an intuitive way why this modeling choice is better than some other natural choices (in addition to empirical verification).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,(2) The real world datasets seem to be quite small (e.g. less than 100 sequences).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,Experimental results reported on larger datasets may also strengthen the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"Putting the score for now, will post the full review tomorrow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,This paper presents a novel model for unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,A recurrent hidden semi-markov model is proposed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,This extends regular hidden semi-markov models to include a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,Each latent class has its own RNN for modeling observations for that category.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"Further, an efficient training procedure based on a variational approximation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for modeling synthetic and real time series data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,This is an interesting and novel paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,The proposed method is a well-motivated combination of duration modeling HMMs with state of the art observation models based on RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,The combination alleviates shortcomings of standard HSMM variants in terms of the simplicity of the emission probability.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,The method is technically sound and demonstrated to be effective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"It would be interesting to see how this method compares quantitatively against CRF-based methods (e.g. Ammar, Dyer, and Smith NIPS 2014).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"CRFs can model more complex data likelihoods, though as noted in the response phase there are still limitations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGODLqgx,"Regardless, I think the merits of using RNNs for the class-specific generative models are clear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,This paper focusses on attention for neural language modeling and has two major contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"1. Authors propose to use separate key, value, and predict vectors for attention mechanism instead of a single vector doing all the 3 functions. This is an interesting extension to standard attention mechanism which can be used in other applications as well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,2. Authors report that very short attention span is sufficient for language models (which is not very surprising) and propose an n-gram RNN which exploits this fact.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The paper has novel models for neural language modeling and some interesting messages.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Authors have done a thorough experimental analysis of the proposed ideas on a language modeling task and CBT task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,I am convinced with authors’ responses for my pre-review questions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"Minor comment: Ba et al., Reed & de Freitas, and Gulcehre et al. should be added to the related work section as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"This paper explores a variety of memory augmented architectures (key, key-value, key-predict-value) and additionally simpler near memory-less RNN architectures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"Using an attention model that has access to the various decompositions is an interesting idea and one worth future explorations, potentially in different tasks where this type of model could excel even more.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The results over the Wikipedia corpus are interesting and feature a wide variety of different model types.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,This is where the models suggested in the paper are strongest.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The same models run over the CBT dataset show a comparable but less convincing demonstration of the variations between the models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The authors also released their Wikipedia corpus already.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Having inspected it I consider it a positive and interesting contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"I still believe that, if a model was found that could better handle longer term dependencies, it would do better on this Wikipedia dataset, but at least within the realm of what .",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"As an example, the first article in train.txt is about a person named ""George Abbot"", yet ""Abbot"" isn't mentioned again until the next sentence 40 tokens later, and then the next ""Abbot"" is 15 tokens from there.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"Most gaps between occurrences of ""Abbot"" are dozens of timesteps.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"Performing an analysis based upon easily accessed information, such as when the same token reappears again or average sentence length, may be useful as an approximation for the length that an attention window may prefer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,This is a well explained paper that raises interesting questions regarding the spans used in existing language modeling approaches and serves as a potential springboard for future directions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The paper presents an investigation of various neural language models designed to query context information from their recent history using an attention mechanism.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"The authors propose to separate the attended vectors into key, value and prediction parts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The results suggest that this helps performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The authors also found that a simple model which which concatenates recent activation vectors performs at a similar level as the more complicated attention-based models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The experimental methodology seems sound in general.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,I do have some issues with the way the dimensionality of the vectors involved in the attention-mechanism is chosen.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"While it’s good that the hidden layer sizes are adapted to ensure similar numbers of trainable parameters for all the models, this doesn’t control for the fact that key/value/prediction vectors of a higher dimensionality may simply work better regardless of whether their dimensions are dedicated to one particular task or used together.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,This separation clearly saves parameters but there could also be benefits of having some overlap of information assuming that vectors that lead to similar predictions may also be required in similar contexts for example.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Some tasks may also require more dimensions than others and the explicit separation prevents the model from discovering and exploiting this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"While memory augmented RNNs and RNNs with attention mechanisms are not new, some of these architectures had not yet been applied to language modeling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"Similarly (and as acknowledged by the authors), the strategy of separating key and value functionality has been proposed before, but not in the context of natural language modeling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,I’m not sure about the novelty of the proposed n-gram RNN because I recall seeing similar architectures before but I understand that novelty was not the point of that architecture as it mainly serves as a proof of the lack of ability of the more complicated architectures to do better.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,In that sense I do consider it an inventive baseline that could be used in future work to test the ability of other models that claim to exploit long-term dependencies.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"The exact computation of the representation h_t was initially not that clear to me (the terms hidden and output can be ambiguous at times) but besides this, the paper is quite clear and generally well-written.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The results in this paper are important because they show that learning long-term dependencies is not a solved problem by any means.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The authors provide a very nice comparison to prior results and the fact that their n-gram RNN is often at least competitive with far more complicated approaches is a clear indication that some of those methods may not capture as much context information as previously thought.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,"The success of the separation of key/value/prediction functionality in attention-based system is also noteworthy although I think this is something that needs to be investigated more thoroughly (i.e., with more control for hyperparameter choices).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Impressive and also interesting results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Good comparison with earlier work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The n-gram RNN is an interesting baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The relation between the attention-mechanism type and the number of hidden units weakens the claim that the key/value/prediction separation is the reason for the increase in performance somewhat.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,The model descriptions are not entirely clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByIAPUcee,I would have liked to have seen what happens when the attention is applied to a much larger context size.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,This paper introduces a model that blends ideas from generative topic models with those from recurrent neural network language models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The authors evaluate the proposed approach on a document level classification benchmark as well as a language modeling benchmark and it seems to work well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,There is also some analysis as to topics learned by the model and its ability to generate text.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Overall the paper is clearly written and with the code promised by the authors others should be able to re-implement the approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,I have 2 potentially major questions I would ask the authors to address:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,1 - LDA topic models make an exchangability (bag of words) assumption.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The discussion of the generative story for TopicRNN should explicitly discuss whether this assumption is also made.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,On the surface it appears it is since y_t is sampled using only the document topic vector and h_t,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,but we know that in practice h_t comes from a recurrent model that observes y_t-1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Not clear how this clean exposition of the generative model relates to what is actually done.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,In the Generating sequential text section it’s clear the topic model can’t generate words without using y_1 - t-1 but this seems inconsistent with the generative model specification.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,This needs to be shown in the paper and made clear to have a complete paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,2 -  The topic model only allows for linear interactions of the topic vector theta.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,It seems like this might be required to keep the generative model tractable but seems like a very poor assumption.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,We would expect the topic representation to have rich interactions with a language model to create nonlinear adjustments to word probabilities for a document.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Please add discussion as to why this modeling choice exists and if possible how future work could modify that assumption (or explain why it’s not such a bad assumption as one might imagine),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Figure 2 colors very difficult to distinguish.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"This paper presents TopicRNN, a combination of LDA and RNN that augments traditional RNN with latent topics by having a switching variable that includes/excludes additive effects from latent topics when generating a word.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"Experiments on two tasks are performed: language modeling on PTB, and sentiment analysis on IMBD.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The authors show that TopicRNN outperforms vanilla RNN on PTB and achieves SOTA result on IMDB.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Some questions and comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"In Table 2, how do you use LDA features for RNN (RNN LDA features)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"I would like to see results from LSTM included here, even though it is lower perplexity than TopicRNN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,I think it's still useful to see how much adding latent topics close the gap between RNN and LSTM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The generated text in Table 3 are not meaningful to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,What is this supposed to highlight?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"Is this generated text for topic ""trading""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,What about the IMDB one?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,How scalable is the proposed method for large vocabulary size (>10K)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,What is the accuracy on IMDB if the extracted features is used directly to perform classification?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,(instead of being passed to a neural network with one hidden state).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"I think this is a fairer comparison to BoW, LDA, and SVM methods presented as baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,This work combines a LDA-type topic model with a RNN and models this by having an additive effect on the predictive distribution via the topic parameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,A variational auto-encoder is used to infer the topic distribution for a given piece of text and the RNN is trained as a RNNLM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The last hidden state of the RNNLM and the topic parameters are then concatenated to use as a feature representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The paper is well written and easy to understand.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"Using the topic as an additive effect on the vocabulary allows for easy inference but intuitively I would expect the topic to affect the dynamics too, e.g. the state of the RNN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The results on using this model as a feature extractor for IMDB are quite strong.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Is the RNN fine-tuned on the labelled IMDB data?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"However, the results for PTB are weaker.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"From the original paper, an ensemble of 2 LSTMs is able to match the topicRNN score.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,This method of jointly modelling topics and a language model seems effective and relatively easy to implement.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,"Finally, the IMDB result is no longer state of the art since this result appeared in May (Miyato et al., Adversarial Training Methods for Semi-Supervised Text Classification).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Some questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,How important is the stop word modelling?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,What do the results look like if l_t = 0.5 for all t?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,It seems surprising that the RNN was more effective than the LSTM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Was gradient clipping tried in the topicLSTM case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Do GRUs also fail to work?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,It is also unfortunate that the model requires a stop-word list.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Is the link in footnote 4 the one that is used in the experiments?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Does factoring out the topics in this way allow the RNN to scale better with more neurons?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,How reasonable does the topic distribution look for individual documents?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,How peaked do they tend to be?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Can you show some examples of the inferred distribution?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,The topics look odd for IMDB with the top word of two of the topics being the same: 'campbell'.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,It would be interesting to compare these topics with those inferred by LDA on the same datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbbOLcex,Minor comments:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"This work introduces a novel method for training GANs by displacing simultaneous SGD, and unrolling the inner optimization in the minmax game as a computational graph.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The paper is very clearly written, and explains the justification very well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The problem being attacked is very significant and important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The approach is novel, however, similar ideas have been tried to solve problems unrelated to GANs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The first quantitative experiment is section 3.3.1, where the authors attempt to find the best z which can generate training examples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,This is done by using L-BFGS on |G(z) - x|.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The claim is that if we're able to find such a z, then the generator can generate this particular training example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"It's demonstrated that 0-step GANs are not able to generate many training examples, while unrolled GANs do.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"However, I find this experiment unreasonable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Being able to find a certain z, which generates a certain sample does not guarantee that this particular mode is high probability.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"In fact, an identity function can potentially beat all the GAN models in the proposed metric.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"And due to Cantor's proof of equivalence between all powers of real spaces, this applies to smaller dimension of z as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"More realistically, it should be possible to generate *any* image from a generator by finding a very specific z. That a certain z exists which can generate a sample does not prove that the generator is not missing modes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,It just proves that the generator is similar enough to an identity function to be able to generate any possible image.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,This metric is thus measuring something potentially tangential to diversity or mode-dropping.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Another problem with this metric is that that showing that the optimization is not able to find a z for a specific training examples does not prove that such a z does not exist, only that it's harder to find.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"So, this comparison might just be showing that unrolled GANs have a smoother function than 0-step GANs, and thus easier to optimize for z.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The second quantitative experiment considers mean pairwise distance between generated samples, and between data samples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The first number is likely to be small in the case of a mode-dropping GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The authors argue that the two numbers being closer to each other is an indication of the generated samples being as diverse as the data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Once again, this metric is not convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,1.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Even though the method is optimizing diversity, for a sanity check, scores for quality such as Inception scores or SSL performance would have been useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Another metric that the authors can consider is training GAN using this approach on the tri-MNIST dataset (concatenation of 3 MNIST digits), which results in 1000 easily-identifiable modes.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Whether this paper is accepted or not, I encourage the authors to investigate this approach further, since the method is promising and interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,# Post-rebuttal review,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The authors have incorporated changed in the paper by adding more experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,These experiments now demonstrate the claims of the paper better.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The paper was already well-written and introduced a novel idea and addressed an important problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The only thing holding this paper back was unconvincing experiments, which now has been corrected.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"Thus, I would increase my score by 2 points, and recommend accepting the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The paper presents an approach for tackling the instability problem that is present in generative adversarial networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The general idea is to allow the generator to ""peek ahead"" at how the discriminator will evolve its decision boundary over-time with the premise that this information should prevent the generator from collapsing to produce only samples from a single mode of the data distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,This is a very well written paper that clearly motivates its attack on an important open issue.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The experiments are well carried out and strongly support the presented idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The pursued approach is substantially more elegant than current existing ""hacks"" that are commonly used to make GANs work in practice.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,I however have three main issues that let me partly doubt the success of the method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,If these can be resolved this paper is a clear candidate for acceptance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"1) I am not entirely convinced that the same effect cannot be obtained by the following procedure: simply train the discriminator for an extended number of K steps when updating the generator (say a number equivalent to the unrolling steps used in the current experiments) then, after the generator was updated undo the K updates to the discriminator and do 1 new update step instead.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,I only briefly glanced at your response to Reviewer2 which seems to imply you now tried something similar to this setup by stopping gradient flow at an appropriate point (although I think this is not exactly equivalent).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,2) I tried to reproduce the simple MNIST example but using a fully connected network instead of an RNN generator without much success.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,Even when unrolling the discriminator for 30-40 steps the generator still engages in mode seeking behavior or does not train at all.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,This could either be because of a bug in my implementation or because of some peculiarities of the RNN generator or because I did not use batch normalization anywhere.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,If it is one of the latter two this would entail a dependence of the proposed approach on specific forms of the discriminator and generator and should be discussed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,My code can be found here https://github.com/iclrreproducer/unrolled_gan,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,see the comments in the file for switching on unrolling and batch normalization in the generator.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,This issue could also be addressed simply by opening up the code and setting up a fully connected network example on your side.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,3),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,For the more complicated data distributions the method is only used in combination with many of the existing tricks for training GANs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,As a result the experiments are much less convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,I personally cannot see a strong difference between the samples generated by any of the CIFAR-10 models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,Why did you not try to remove batch-normalization etc. for these examples ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,Does training then again become unstable ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,UPDATE,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,I am leaving the initial review intact to preserve the conversation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"After the authors response all points have been resolved, including a fix to my re-implementation of the ideas presented in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,As a result I have increased my score and believe the paper should be accepted.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,Please also see my response to the rebuttal below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,The paper introduces a technique for stabilizing the training of Generative Adversrial Networks by unrolling the inner (discriminator) optimization in the GAN loss function several steps and optimizing the generator with respect to the final state of this optimization process.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,"The experimental evidence that this actually helps is very compelling: the 2d example shows a toy problem where this technique helps substantially, the LSTM MNIST generator example shows that the procedure helps with stabilizing the training of an unusual architecture of generator, and the image generation experiment, while not being definitive, is very convincing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,For future work it would be interesting to see whether a method with smaller memory requirements could be devised based on similar principles.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydrOIcle,I strongly recommend to accept this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,This paper proposes a k-shot learning framework that can be used on existing pre-trained networks by grouping filters that produce similar activations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,The grouped filters are learned together to address overfitting when only few training samples are available.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"The idea of the paper is interesting there are some encouraging results, but the current version doesn't seem ready for publication:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Performance:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"The method should be compared with other state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods (e.g., Matching Networks by Vinyals et al., 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,It's not clear how this method compares against them.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Missing explanation:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Experimental setting for k-shot learning should be more detailed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Measure:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Accuracy difference does not look like a good idea for comparing the baseline method and the proposed one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Just raw accuracies would be fine.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"Many grammatical errors and inappropriate formatting of citations, such as:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,M. et al. (2011),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,ImageNet (Alex et al. (2012)),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,Judy et al. (2013): this reference appears three times in the reference section.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,This paper proposes a regularization technique for k-shot learning based on orthogonal grouping of units in a neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"The units within a group are forced to be maximally similar, at the same time the units from different groups are encouraged to be orthogonal.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"While I like the motivation of the approach, the empirical analysis provided in the paper doesn’t look particularly convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,My main concerns are the following:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,1. The method is sensitive to the values of alpha and beta and a poor choice of those hyperparameters can lead to a quite drastic drop in performance comparing the minor gains one gets when alpha and beta are set properly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"2. It seems strange that the best performance is obtained when the group's size ratio is 0.5. From the figures in the paper, it follows that usually, one has more “orthogonal” groups in a filter bank. I have an impression that the empirical evidence doesn’t align well with the motivation of the proposed approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,3. The paper contains a significant amount of typos and incorrectly formatted references. There are also several places in the manuscript that I found hard to understand due to unusual phrasing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,I would like to thank the authors for answering/addressing my pre-review questions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,I would be grateful if the authors could provide more clarifications of the following:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"1. Question 2: I’m not sure if modifying \theta_{map} alone would result in any learning at all. Do I understand correctly that \theta_{map} is only used to define groups? If so, then I don’t see how the proposed method can be used in the purely unsupervised regime.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,2. Question 3: I was not referring to the fixed clustering based on the filter of the pre-trained network. One can perform that clustering at every step of the k-shot learning process. I’m not sure I understand why the authors visualize grouping of _filters_ while in the actual algorithm they group _activations_.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"Overall, the paper is quite interesting but needs a stronger empirical justification of the approach as well as a better presentation of the material.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,The authors of this work propose a learnable approach to reducing the dimensionality of learned filters in deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"This is an interesting approach, but the presented work looks a bit raw.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,1. There are many typos in this manuscript.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,2. The experimental results are rather weak and don't show much improvement in accuracy. Instead the authors could position this work as a compression mechanism and would have to compare to low rank approximation of filters for DNNs. Yet this is not done.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"3. Aside from compression, OMG can be viewed as a form of regularization to reduce the unnecessary capacity of the network to improve generalization. Again, this is not addressed in enough detail.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1HcOI5le,"4. If the authors care to compare their approach to other 1-shot learning methods, then they would have to evaluate their approach with siamese and triplet learning networks. This isn't done.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Paper Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,This paper presents a new large scale machine reading comprehension dataset called MS MARCO.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"It is different from existing datasets in that the questions are real user queries, the context passages are real web documents, and free form answers are generated by humans instead of spans in the context.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The paper also includes some analysis of the dataset and performance of QA models on the dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Paper Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The questions in the dataset are real queries from users instead of humans writing questions given some context.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Context passages are extracted from real web documents which are used by search engines to find answers to the given query.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Answers are generated by humans instead of being spans in context.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"It is large scale dataset, with an aim of 1 million queries.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Current release includes 100,000 queries.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Paper Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"The authors say, ""We have found that the distribution of actual questions users ask intelligent agents can be very different from those conceived from crowdsourcing them from the text."", but the statement is not backed up with any study.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The paper doesn't clearly present what additional information can today's QA models learn from MS MARCO which they can't from existing datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The paper should talk about what challenges are involved in obtaining a good performance on this dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,What are the human performances as compared to the models presented in the paper?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"In section 4.1, what are the train/test splits?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The results are for the subset of MS MARCO where every query has multiple answers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,How big is that subset?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"What is DSSM mentioned in row 2, Table 5?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The authors should include in the paper how experiments in section 4.2 prove that MS MARCO is a better dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"In Table 6, the performance of Memory Networks is already close to Best Passage.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Does that mean there is not enough room for improvement there?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"The paper seems to be written in hurry, with partial analysis, evaluation and various mistakes in the text.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Preliminary Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,The proposed dataset MS MARCO is unique from existing datasets as it is a good representative of the QA task encountered by search engines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,I think it can be a very useful dataset for the community to benefit from.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Given the huge potential in the dataset, this paper lacks the analysis and evaluation needed to present the dataset's worth.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,I think it can benefit a lot with a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,This is a dataset paper that brings unique values over existing reading comprehension challenges.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Unlike others, MS MARCO is derived from query logs, thus represents real questions that people ask, rather than solicited questions that might be rather artificial in practical settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,There are potential downsides of using query logs however.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,It may be that people adapt their language and questions for search engines such that users ask questions that they know current search engines can reasonably answer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Thus, it may be that people limit the complexity of questions or language or both.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"I think authors could have addressed this concern by being more selective about the query logs, by down-sampling on simple questions that can be easily answered by keyword matching without any sophisticated reading comprehension, and up-sampling more complex questions that require at least paraphrasing and ideally synthesis of information taken from more than one sentences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"It’s great that there are several new efforts to construct large-scale reading comprehension challenges, but my main concern is whether the majority of the questions can be answered through relatively easy text matching without intelligent reading or reasoning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Also, the paper reads like the authors were running out of time before the deadline.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"I would appreciate more analytic and quantitative comparisons against other existing datasets, and more insights on the degree of challenges required to handle QAs in MS MARCO.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"For example, the authors could collect statistics on QAs: (1) exact match exists in the text snippet, (2) paraphrasing is required but otherwise the relevant answer is directly available in the text snippet, (3) requires synthesizing information taken from more than one sentences, (4) requires external knowledge.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"The author response mentions that (4) is unlikely, but a more formal and complete analysis would be helpful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Summary: The paper proposes a large-scale dataset for reading comprehension, with the final goal of releasing 1 million questions and answers. The authors have currently released 100,000 queries and their answers. The dataset differs from existing reading comprehension datasets mainly w.r.t queries being sampled from user queries rather than being generated by crowd-workers and answers being generated by crowd-workers rather than being spans of text from the provided passage. The paper presents some analysis of the dataset such as distribution of answer types. The paper also presents the results of some generative and some cloze-style models on the MS MARCO dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"1. The paper provides useful insights about the limitations of the existing reading comprehension datasets – questions asked by crowd-workers have different distribution compared to that of questions asked by actual users of intelligent agents, answers being restricted to span from the reading text rather than requiring reasoning across multiple pieces of text/passages.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"2. MS MARCO dataset has novel useful characteristics compared to existing reading comprehension datasets – questions are sampled from user queries, answers are generated by humans.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,3. The experimental evaluation of the existing baseline models on the MS MARCO dataset is satisfactory.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,Weaknesses/Suggestions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,1. The paper does not report human performance on the dataset. Human performance should be reported to estimate the difficulty of the dataset. The degree of inter-human agreement will also reflect how well the metric (being used to compute inter-human agreement and accuracies of the baseline models) can deal with variance in the sentence structure with similar semantics.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,2. I would like to see the comparison between the answer type distribution in the MS MARCO dataset and that in existing reading comprehension datasets such as SQuAD. This would ground the claim made in the paper the distributions of questions asked by crowd-workers is different from that of user queries.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"3. The paper uses automatic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU for evaluating natural language answers. However, it is known that such metrics poorly correlate with human judgement for tasks such as image caption evaluation (Chen et al., Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server, CoRR abs/1504.00325 (2015)). So, I wonder how authors justify using such metrics for evaluating open-ended natural language answers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"4. The paper mentions that a classifier was used to filter answer seeking queries from all Bing queries. It would be good to mention the accuracy of this classifier. This will provide insights into what percentage of the MS MARCO questions are answer seeking queries. Similarly, what is the accuracy of the information retrieval based system used to retrieve passages for filtered queries?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,5. Please include the description of the best passage baseline in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"6. Fix opening quotes, i.e. ” -> “ (for instance, on page 5, ”what” -> “what”).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"Review Summary: The paper is well motivated, the use of user queries and human generated answers makes the dataset different from existing datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"However, I would like to see the human performance on the dataset and quantitative comparison between the distribution of questions obtained from user queries and that of crowd-sourced questions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk1iOLcle,"I would also like the authors to comment on the use of automatic metrics (such as ROUGE, BLEU) in the light of the fact that such metrics do not correlate well with human judgements for tasks such as image caption evaluation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,This paper proposes an interesting application of the GAN framework in steganography domain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"In addition to the normal GAN discriminator, there is a steganalyser discriminator that receives the negative examples from the generator and positive examples from the generator images that contain a hidden payload.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"As a result, the generator, not only learn to generate realistic images by fooling the discriminator of the GAN, but also learn to be a secure container by fooling steganalyser discriminator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,The method is tested by training an independent steganalyser S* on real images and generated images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Given that in the ICLR community, not many people are familiar with the literature of steganography, I think this paper should have provided more context about how exactly this method can be used in practice, what are the related works on setganalysis-secure message embedding and probably a more thorough sets of experiments on more than one dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"The proposed SGAN framework (Figure 2) does make sense to me, and I think it is very general and can have more applications other than the steganography domain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"But it is not clear to me why fooling the steganalyser discriminator S, necessarily mean that we can fool an independent discriminator S*?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Also I find it surprising that a different seed value, can make such a huge difference in the accuracy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"In short, the ideas of this paper are interesting and potentially useful, but I think the presentation of this paper should be improved so that it becomes more suitable for the ICLR and machine learning community.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"I found this paper very original and thought-provoking, but also a bit difficult to understand.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"It is very exciting to see a practical use case for image-generating GANs, with potentially meaningful benchmarks aside from subjective realism.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,I found eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"4 interesting because it introduces a potentially non-differentiable black-box function Stego(...) into the training of (S, G).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Do you in fact backprop through the Stego function?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"For the train/test split, why is the SGAN trained on all 200k images?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Would it not be cleaner to use the same splits for training SGAN as for ""steganalysis purposes""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Could this account for the sensitivity to random seed shown in table 2?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Sec. 5.3: ""Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can potentially be used as a universal tool for generating Steganography containers tuned to deceive any specific steganalysis algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,""".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"This experiment showed that SGAN can fool HUGO, but I do not see how it was ""tuned"" to deceive HUGO, or how it could be tuned in general for a particular steganalyzer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Although S* seems to be fooled by the proposed method, in general for image generation the discriminator D is almost never fooled.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"I.e. contemporary GANs never converge to actually fooling the discriminator, even if they produce samples that sometimes fool humans.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,What if I created an additional steganalyzer S**(x) = S*(x) * D(x)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,This I think would be extremely difficult to fool reliably because it requires realistic image generation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"After reading the paper several times, it is still a bit unclear to me how or why precisely one would use a trained SGAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"I think the paper could be greatly improved by detailing, step by step, the workflow of how a hypothetical user would use a trained SGAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,This description should be aimed at a reader who knows nothing or very little about steganography (e.g. most of ICLR attendees).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,I reviewed the manuscript as of December 6th.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,The authors build upon generative adversarial networks for the purpose of steganalysis,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,i.e. detecting hidden messages in a payload.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"The authors describe a new model architecture in which a new element, a 'steganalyser' is added a training objective to the GAN model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Major Comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,The authors introduce an interesting new direction for applying generative networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"That said, I think the premise of the paper could stand some additional exposition.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,How exactly would a SGAN method be employed?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,This is not clear from the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Why does the model require a generative model?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Steganalysis by itself seems like a classification problem (i.e. a binary decision if there a hidden message?),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Would you envision that a user has a message to send and does not care about the image (container) that it is being sent with?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Or does the user have an image and the network generates a synthetic version of the image as a container and then hide the message in the container?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Or is the SGAN somehow trained as a method for detecting hidden codes performed by any algorithm in an image?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Explicitly describing the use-case would help with interpreting the results in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"Additionally, the experiments and analysis in this paper is quite light as the authors only report a few steganalysis performance numbers in the tables (Table 1,2,3).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,"A more extensive analysis seems warranted to explore the parameter space and provide a quantitative comparison with other methods discussed (e.g. HUGO, WOW, LSB, etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,When is it appropriate to use this method over the others?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Why does the seed effect the quality of results?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Does a fixed seed correspond realistic scenario for employing this method?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Is Figure 1 necessary?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1hoFU9xe,Why does the seed value effect the quality of the predictive performance of the model?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,This paper introduces a large-scale multi-model product classification system.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"The model consists of three modules, Image CNN (VGG 16 architecture), text CNN (Kim 2014) and decision-level fusion policies.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,The authors have tried several fusion methods: including policies taking inputs from text and image CNN probabilities; choose either CNN; average the predictions; end-to-end training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,Experimental results show that text CNN alone works better than image CNN and multi-model fusion can improve the accuracy by a small margin.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,It is a little bit surprising that end-to-end feature level fusion works worse than text CNN alone.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,The writing is clear and there are a lot of useful practical experiences of learning large-scale model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,1),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,No other dataset reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,The authors haven't mentioned releasing the walmart dataset and it is going to be really hard to reproduce the results without the dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,2) Technical novelty is limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,All the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by some previous methods before.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,3) Performance gain is also limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,This paper tackles the problem of multi-modal classification of text and images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,Interesting dataset and application.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"The results are rather lacklustre, showing a very mild improvement compared to the oracle improvement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,But perhaps some insights as to whether the incorrect decisions are humanly possible would help with significance of the results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,Could have explored some intermediate architectures such as feature fusion + class probabilities with/without finetuning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,There are no feature fusion results reported.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,No evaluation on standard datasets or comparison to previous works.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"Given 2 input class probabilities, how does the network perform better than max or mean?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,This paper presents a system approach to combine multiple modalities to perform classification in a practical scenario (e-commerce).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"In general, I find the proposed approach in the paper sound and solid, but do not see novelty in the paper: feature fusion and decision time fusion are both standard practices in multi-modal analysis, and the rest of the paper offers no surprise in implementing such approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge,"This seems to be a better fit for venues that focus more on production systems, and seems to be a bad fit for ICLR where the focus is more on research of novel algorithms and theories.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkSmc8qll,The authors proposed a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) model that overcomes the rigid location-based memory access used in the original NTM model.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC_jUqxe,This paper introduces a sentence encoding model (for use within larger text understanding models) that can extract a matrix-valued sentence representation by way of within-sentence attention.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC_jUqxe,"The new model lends itself to (slightly) more informative visualizations than could be gotten otherwise, and beats reasonable baselines on three datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC_jUqxe,"The paper is reasonably clear, I see no major technical issues, and the proposed model is novel and effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC_jUqxe,It could plausibly be relevant to sequence modeling tasks beyond NLP.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,This paper tries to solve the problem of interpretable representations with focus on Sum Product Networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"The authors argue that SPNs are a powerful linear models that are able to learn parts and their combinations, however, their representations havent been fully exploited by generating embeddings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The idea is interesting and interpretable models/representations is an important topic.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Generating embeddings to interpret SPNs is a novel idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The experiments are interesting but could be extended.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The author's contribution isn't fully clear and there are multiple claims that need support.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"For example, SPNs are indeed interpretable as is, since the bottom-up propagation of information from the visible inputs could be visualized at every stage, and the top-down parse could be also visualized as it has been done before (Amer & Todorovic, 2015).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"Another example, Proposition one claims that MPNs are perfect encoder decoders since the max nodes always have one max value, however, what if it was uniformally distributed node, or there are two equal values?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Did the authors run into such cases?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Did they address all edge cases?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"A good comparison could have been against Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs) and Variational Autoencoders too since they are the state-of-the-art generative models, rather than comparing with RBMs and Nade.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"I would suggest that the authors take sometime to evaluate their approach against the suggested methods, and make sure to clarify their contributions and eliminate over claiming statements.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,I agree with the other comments raised by Anon-Reviewer1.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The paper's aim is - as argued in the paper and the responses to other reviewers comments - that SPN and MPN can be interpreted as encoders and decoders of RL.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Well - this is an interesting perspective and could be (potentially) worth a paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,However,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,the current draft is far from being convincing in that respect - and I am talking about the updated / improved version as of now.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The paper does not require minor revisions to make this point apparent - but a significant and major rewrite which seems beyond what the authors have done so far.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,the experiments are (as also pointed out by other reviewers) rather unstructured and difficult to see much of an insight.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,I should probably also list (as the other other reviewers) flaws and issues with the experiments - but given the detailed comments by the other reviewers there seems to be little additional value in doing so,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,So in essence the paper simply does not deliver at this point on its promise (as far as I am concerned) and in that sense I suggest a very clear reject for this conference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,As for the dataset employed: MNIST should be considered a toy-dataset for pretty much all purposes these days - and in that sense the dataset choice is not helping me (and many other people that you might want to convince) to safe this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"The authors propose and evaluate using SPN's to generate embeddings of input and output variables, and using MPN to decode output embeddings to output variables.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The advantage of predicting label embeddings is to decouple dependencies in the predicted space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The authors show experimentally that using SPN based embeddings is better than those produced by RBM's.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,This paper is fairly dense and a bit hard to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"After the discussion, the main contributions of the authors are:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"1. They propose the scheme of learning SPN's over Y and then using MPN's to decode the output, or just SPNs to embed X.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,2. They propose how to decode MPN's with partial data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,3. They perform some analysis of when their scheme will lead to perfect encoding/decodings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"4. They run many, many experiments comparing various ways of using their proposed method to make predictions on multi-label classification datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,My main concerns with this paper are as follows:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The point of this paper is about using generative models for representation learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"In their experiments, the main task is discriminative; e.g. predict multiple Y from X. The only discriminative baseline is a L2 regularized logistic regression, which does not have any structure on the output; it'd be nice to see how a discriminative structured prediction method would do, such as CRF or belief propagation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,The many experiments suggest that their encoder/decoder scheme is working better than the alternatives; can you please give more details on the relative computation complexity of each method?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,One thing I'm still having trouble understanding is *why* this method works better than MADE and the other alternatives.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Is it learning a better model of the distribution of Y?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Is it better at separating out correlations in the output into individual nodes?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Does it have larger representations?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"I think the experiments are overkill and if anything, they way they are presented detract from the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,There's already far too many numbers and graphs presented to be easy to understand.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"If I have to dig through hundreds of numbers to figure out if your claim is correct, the paper is not clear enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"And, I said this before in my comments, please do not refer to Q1, Q2, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,these shortcuts let you make the paper more dense with fewer words but at the cost of readability.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,I *think*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"I convinced myself that your method works...I would love to see a table that shows, for each condition: (A) a baseline X->Y, (B) one *average* result across datasets for your method, and (C) one *average* result from a reasonable best competitor method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"Please show for both the exact match and hamming losses, as that will demonstrate the gap between independent linear prediction and structured prediction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,That would still be plenty of numbers but would make it much easier for the reader to verify your claims and you can put everything else in the Appendix.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,E.g. something like:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Input | Predicted Output | Decoder | Hamming | Exact Match,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,X | P(Y),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,| CRF | xx.xx | xx.xx   (this is your baseline),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,SPN E_X | P(Y),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,| n/a | xx.xx | xx.xx,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"X | SPN E_Y | MPN | xx.xx | xx.xx  (given X, predict E_Y, then decode it with an MPN)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,Does a presentation like that make sense?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Bjj8qge,"It's just really hard and time-consuming for me as a reviewer to verify your results, the way you've laid them out currently.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"This paper presented a method of improving the efficiency of deep networks acting on a sequence of correlated inputs, by only performing the computations required to capture changes between adjacent inputs.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,The benefits of this approach are still more theoretical than practical,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,it seems unlikely to be worthwhile to do this on current hardware.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"I strongly suspect that if deep networks were trained with an appropriate sparse slowness penalty, the reduction in computation would be much larger.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,The paper presents a method to improve the efficiency of CNNs that encode sequential inputs in a ‘slow’ fashion such that there is only a small change between the representation of adjacent steps in the sequence.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,It demonstrates theoretical performance improvements for toy video data (temporal mnist) and natural movies with a powerful Deep CNN (VGG).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,The improvement is naturally limited by the ‘slowness’ of the CNN representation that is transformed into a sigma-delta network: CNNs that are specifically designed to have ‘slow’ representations will benefit most.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"Also, it is likely that only specialised hardware can fully harness the improved efficiency achieved by the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"Thus as of now, the full potential of the method cannot be thoroughly evaluated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"However, since the processing of sequential data seems to be a broad and general area of application, it is conceivable that this work will be useful in the design and application of future CNNs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"All in all, this paper introduces an interesting idea to address an important topic.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"It shows promising initial results, but the demonstration of the actual usefulness and relevance of the presented method relies on future work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,This is an interesting paper about quantized networks that work on temporal difference inputs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,The basic idea is that when a network has only to process differences then this is computational much more efficient specifically with natural video data since large parts of an image would be fairly constant so that the network only has to process the informative sections of the image (video stream).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"This is of course how the human visual system works, and it is hence of interest even beyond the core machine learning community.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"I guess the biggest novel contribution is that a rounding network can be replaced by a sigma-delta network, but that the order of discretization and summation doe make some difference in the actual processing load.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,I think I followed the steps and,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,Most of my questions have already been answers in the pre-review period.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"My only question remaining is on page 3, “It should be noted that when we refer to “temporal differences”, we refer not to the change in the signal over time, but in the change between two inputs presented sequentially.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,"The output of our network only depends on the value and order of inputs, not on the temporal spacing between them.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,This does not make sense to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNRsU5ge,As I understand you just take the difference between two frames regardless if you call this temporal or not it is a change in one frame.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Fk2Iqex,Also introduced is the idea of initializing (pre-training) CNN layers to mimic chirplet transform of audio signal (similar to ideas proposed by Mallet et al. on scattering transforms).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1Fk2Iqex,"The paper is fairly easy to follow but in a few places contains undefined terms (e.g. AM-FM, MAP).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The paper presents a few tricks to compress a wide and shallow text classification model based on n-gram features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,These tricks include (1) using (optimized) product quantization to compress embedding weights (2) pruning some of the vocabulary elements (3) hashing to reduce the storage of the vocabulary (this is a minor component of the paper).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The paper focuses on models with very large vocabularies and shows a reduction in the size of the models at a relatively minor reduction of the accuracy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The problem of compressing neural models is important and interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The methods section of the paper is well written with good high level comments and references.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,"However, the machine learning contributions of the paper are marginal to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The experiments are not too convincing mainly focusing on benchmarks that are not commonly used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The implications of the paper on the state-of-the-art RNN text classification models is unclear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The use of (optimized) product quantization for approximating inner product is not particularly novel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,Previous work also considered doing this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,Most of the reduction in the model sizes comes from pruning vocabulary elements.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,The method proposed for pruning vocabulary elements is simply based on the assumption that embeddings with larger L2 norm are more important.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,A coverage heuristic is taken into account too.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,"From a machine learning point of view, the proper baseline to solve this problem is to have a set of (relaxed) binary coefficients for each embedding vector and learn the coefficients jointly with the weights.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJc1hL5ee,"From a practical point of view, I believe an important baseline is missing: what if one simply uses fewer vocabulary elements (e.g based on subword units - see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909.pdf) and retrain a smaller models?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,section 3.1.2: “learni”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,Thanks a lot for your detailed response and clarifications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,The paper proposes to use a scattering transform as the lower layers of a deep network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,This fixed representation enjoys good geometric properties (local invariance to deformations) and can be thought as a form of regularization or prior.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,The top layers of the network are trained to perform a given supervised task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,This is the final model can be thought as plugging a standard deep convolutional network on top of the scattering transform.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,Evaluation on CIFAR 10 and 100 shows that the proposed approach achieves performance competitive with high performing baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,I find the paper very interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,The idea of cascading these representations seems very natural thing to try.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,To the best of my knowledge this is the first work that combines predefined and generic representations with modern CNN architectures achieving competitive performance to high performing approaches.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,"While the state of the art (Resnets and variants) achieves significantly higher performances, I believe that this work strongly delivers it's point.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,"The paper convincingly shows that lower level invariances can be obtained from analytic representations (scattering transform), simplifying the training process (using less parameters) and allowing for faster evaluation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,The of the hybrid approach become crucial in the low data regime.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,The author argues that with the scattering initialisation instabilities cannot occur in the first layers contrary as the operator is non-expansive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,This naturally suggests that the model is more robust to adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,It would be extremely interesting to present an empirical evaluation of this task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,What's the practical impact?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,Can this hybrid network be fooled with adversarial?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryPx38qge,"If this is the case, it would render the use of scattering initialization very attractive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,This paper presents a novel layer-wise optimization approach for learning CNN with piecewise linear nonlinearities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"The proposed approach trains piecewise linear CNNs layer by layer and reduces the sub-problem into latent structured SVM, which has been well-studied in the literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"In addition, the paper presents improvements of the BCFW algorithm used in the inner procedure.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Overall, this paper is interesting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"However, unfortunately, the experiment is not convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"To my best knowledge, the proposed approach is novel, and the authors provide nice theoretical analysis.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,The paper is well-written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Although the proposed approach can be applied in general structured prediction problem, the experiments only conduct on a simple multi-class classification task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,This makes this work less compelling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,The test accuracy performance on CIFAR-10 reported in the paper doesn't look right.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,The accuracy of the best model reported in this paper is 70.2% while existing work often reports 90+%.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"For example, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf showed an accuracy of 91% without data augmentation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Also, CIFAR-10 is a relatively small dataset,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Other comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"If I understand correctly, BCFW only guarantees monotonically increasing in the dual objective and does not have guarantees on the primal objective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Especially, in practice, the inner optimization process often stops pretty early (i.e., stops when duality gap is still large).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Therefore, when putting them together, the CCCP procedure may not monotonically decrease as the inner procedure is only solved approximately.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,The authors should add this note when they discuss the properties of their algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,A layer wise optimization for CNNs with ReLU activations and max-pooling is proposed and shown to correspond to a series of latent structured SVM problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Using CCCP style optimization a monotonic decrease of the overall objective function can be guaranteed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,———,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,I think the discussed insights are very interesting but not presented convincingly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Firstly, claims are emphasized which are often violated in practice (e.g., no convergence guarantees due to mini-batches), statements could be validated more convincingly (e.g., is monotone convergence a curse or a blessing), the experimental evaluation should be extended.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"In summary, I think the paper requires some more attention to form a compelling story.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"At times apples are compared to oranges, e.g., back propagation is contrasted with CCCP.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Originality: The suggested idea is reasonable albeit heuristics are required.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Details:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,————,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"1. I think the provided guarantees for the optimization procedure are certainly convenient theoretically but their practical relevance still needs to be demonstrated more convincingly, e.g., mini-batch optimization alleviates any form of monotonic decrease. Hence the emphasize in the paper is somewhat misguided according to my opinion and given he current experimental evaluation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"2. In spirit similar is work by B. Amos and J. Kolter, Input-Convex Deep Networks (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ROVmA279BsvnM0J1IpNn) ICLR Workshop Track 2016; which should probably be mentioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"3. I think the comparison between backprop and the discussed CCCP approach is not really appropriate. Note that backprop is a mechanism to compute gradients and is not at all related to any optimization technique/algorithm. This means that backprop combined with Armijo line-search would for example result in convergence guarantees. Hence a statement like `one of the main advantages of our approach compared to back propagation and its variants, which fail to provide similar guarantees on the value of the objective function from one iteration to the next’ is according to my opinion superficial.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,4. More justification regarding the argument that search for the step-size is a disadvantage seems necessary. There is evidence that noise introduced by mini-batches and inaccurate/no line search is actually beneficial. In contrast the proposed CCCP procedure may converge pre-maturely to a local optimum close to the initialization. Since mini-batches are used no guarantees are available in any case. Hence I think additional evidence for the fact that such convergence guarantees don’t result in premature stopping seems necessary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,5. The observation 1 required to convert the layer wise procedure into an SVM seems rather ad-hoc. Note that you can easily construct examples where Eq. (9) and Eq. (7) differ significantly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"6. I personally think the experimental evaluation is conducted on examples that are too small and some results are obvious. E.g., LW-SVM always improves over the solution of the SGD algorithm. If the authors were to use backtracking line search they could also improve upon LW-SVM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,This paper proposes a new approaches for optimizing the objective of CNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"The proposed method uses a lay-wise optimization, i.e. at each step, it optimizes the parameters in one layer of CNN while fixing the parameters in other layers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"The key insight of this paper is that, for a large class of CNNs, the optimization problem at a particular can be formulated as optimizing a piecewise linear (PL) function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,This PL function optimization happens to be the optimization problem commonly encountered in latent structural SVM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"This connection allows this paper to borrows ideas from the latent structural SVM literature, in particular concave-convex procedure, to learn the parameters of CNNs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Overall, the paper is well-written.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Traditional, CNNs and structural SVMs are almost two separate research communties.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"The connection of CNNs to latent structural SVM is interesting, and might bridge the gap and facilitate the transferring of ideas between these two camps.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Of course, the proposed method also has some limitations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,1) It is limited to layer-wise optimization.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Nowadays layer-wise optimization is essentially a coordinate descent algorithm and is not really a competitive strategy in learning CNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"When you choose layer-wise optimization, you already lose something in terms of optimizing the objective (since you are using coordinate descent, instead of gradient descent).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Of course, you also gain something since now you can guarantee that each coordinate descent step always improve the objective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,It is not clear to me how the loss/gain balances each other.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,2),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,This paper focues on improving the optimization of CNN objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"However, we all know that a better objective does not necessarily correspond to a good model (e.g. due to overfitting).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"Although the SGD with backprop in standard CNN learning does not always improve the solution of the objective (unlike the proposed method in this paper), but to me, this might be a good thing since it can prevent overfitting (the goal of learning is not to get better solution for the optimization problem in the first place",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,the optimization problem is merely a proxy to learn a model with good generalization ability).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,The experiment is a bit weak.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,1) Only CIFAR10 is used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"This is a very small dataset by today's standard, while CNNs are typically used in large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,It is not clear whether the conclusions of this paper still hold when applied on ImageNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,2),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"This paper only compares with a crippled variant of SGD (without batch normalization, dropout, etc).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,Although this paper mentions that the reason is that it wants to focus on optimization.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,"But I mentioned earlier, SGD is not designed to purely obtain the best solution that optimizes the objective, the goal of SGD is to reasonably optimize the objective, while preventing overfitting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By5e2L9gl,So the comparison to SGD purely in terms of the optimization is that meaningful in the first place.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,This work proposes to use basic probability assignment to improve deep transfer learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,A particular re-weighting scheme inspired by Dempster-Shaffer and exploiting the confusion matrix of the source task is introduced.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,The authors also suggest learning the convolutional filters separately to break non-convexity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,The main problem with this paper is the writing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"There are many typos, and the presentation is not clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"For example, the way the training set for weak classifiers are constructed remains unclear to me despite the author's previous answer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,I do not buy the explanation about the use of both training and validation sets to compute BPA.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Also, I am not convinced non-convexity is a problem here and the author does not provide an ablation study to validate the necessity of separately learning the filters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,One last question is CIFAR has three channels and MNIST only one: How it this handled when pairing the datasets in the second set of experiments?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Overall, I believe the proposed idea of reweighing is interesting, but the work can be globally improved/clarified.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,I suggest a reject.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,Update: I thank the author for his comments!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"At this point, the paper is still not suitable for publication, so I'm leaving the rating untouched.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,This paper proposes a transfer learning method addressing optimization complexity and class imbalance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,My main concerns are the following:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"1. The paper is quite hard to read due to typos, unusual phrasing and loose use of terminology like “distributed”, “transfer learning” (meaning “fine-tuning”), “softmax” (meaning “fully-connected”), “deep learning” (meaning “base neural network”),  etc. I’m still not sure I got all the details of the actual algorithm right.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,2. The captions to the figures and tables are not very informative – one has to jump back and forth through the paper to understand what the numbers/images mean.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"3. From what I understand, the authors use “conventional transfer learning” to refer to fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers only (I’m judging by Figure 1). In this case, it’s essential to compare the proposed method with regimes when some of the convolutional layers are also updated. This comparison is not present in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,Comments on the pre-review questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"1. Question 1: If the paper only considers the case |C|==|L|, it would be better to reduce the notation clutter.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"2. Question 2: It is still not clear what the authors mean by distributed transfer learning. Figure 1 is supposed to highlight the difference from the conventional approach (fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers; by the way, I don’t think, Softmax is a conventional term for fully-connected layers). From the diagram, it follows that the base CNN has the same number of convolutional filters at every layer and, in order to obtain a distributed ensemble, we need to connect (for some reason) filters with the same indices. This does not make a lot of sense to me but I’m probably misinterpreting the figure. Could the authors revise the diagram to make it clearer?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Overall, I think the paper needs significant refinement in order improve the clarity of presentation and thus cannot be accepted as it is now.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,This paper proposed to use the BPA criterion for classifier ensembles.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"My major concern with the paper is that it attempts to mix quite a few concepts together, and as a result, some of the simple notions becomes a bit hard to understand.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,For example:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"(1) ""Distributed"" in this paper basically means classifier ensembles, and has nothing to do with the distributed training or distributed computation mechanism.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Granted, one can train these individual classifiers in a distributed fashion but this is not the point of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"(2) The paper uses ""Transfer learning"" in its narrow sense: it basically means fine-tuning the last layer of a pre-trained classifier.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Aside from the concept mixture of the paper, other comments I have about the paper are:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,(1) I am not sure how BPA address class inbalance better than simple re-weighting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"Essentially, the BPA criteria is putting equal weights on different classes, regardless of the number of training data points each class has.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,This is a very easy thing to address in conventional training: adding a class-specific weight term to each data point with the value being the inverse of the number of data points will do.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"(2) Algorithm 2 is not presented correctly as it implies that test data is used during training, which is not correct: only training and validation dataset should be used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"I find the paper's use of ""train/validation"" and ""test"" quite confusing: why ""train/validation"" is always presented together?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,How to properly distinguish between them?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"(3) If I understand correctly, the paper is proposing to compute the BPA in a batch fashion, i.e. BPA can only be computed when running the model over the full train/validation dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,This contradicts with the stochastic gradient descent that are usually used in deep net training - how does BPA deal with that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,I believe that an experimental report on the computation cost and timing is missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJN38cge,"In general, I find the paper not presented in its clearest form and a number of key definitions ambiguous.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,The authors present a method for training probabilistic models by maximizing a stochastic variational-lower-bound-type objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"Training involves sampling and then learning a transition-based inference to ""walk back"" samples to the data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"Because of its focus on transitions, it can be used to learn a raw transition operator rather than purely learning an energy-based model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,The objective is intuitively appealing because of its similarity to previous successful but less principled training methods for MRFs like Contrastive Divergence.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"The idea for the algorithm is appealing, and it looks like it could find a nice place in the literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"However, the submission in its current form is not yet ready for publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,Experiments are qualitative and the generated samples are not obviously indicative of a high model quality.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"As pointed out elsewhere, the mathematical analysis does not currently demonstrate tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,More evaluation using e.g. annealed importance sampling to estimate held-out likelihoods is necessary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"Assuming that the analysis can be repaired, the ability to directly parametrize a transition operator, an interesting strength of this method, should be explored in further experiments and contrasted with the more standard energy-based modeling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"This looks like a promising idea, and other reviews and questions have already raised some important technical points which should help strengthen this paper for future submission.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,I very much like the underlying idea for this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,I wasn't convinced by the execution in its current state.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"My primary concern is the one I expressed in my pre-review question below, which I don't think the authors addressed.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"This paper proposes a new kind of generative model based on an annealing process, where the transition probabilities are learned directly to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"Overall, the idea is clever and appealing, but I think the paper needs more quantitative validation and better discussion of the relationship with prior work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkpdnIqlx,"In terms of prior work, AIS and RAISE are both closely related algorithms, and share much of the mathematical structure with the proposed method.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The task itself (superoptimization) is not of significant interest to ICLR readers/attendees.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,A conference like AAAI/UAI seem a better fit for this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The proposed method is seemingly novel.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Typical MCMC-based synthesis methods are lacking due to their being no learning components in them.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"Since a BoW feature is used to represent the programs, the neural network cannot possibly learn anything more than just correlations between presence of opcodes and good moves.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Such a model cannot possibly understand the program semantics in any way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,It would have been a more interesting contribution if the authors had used a model (such as Tree-LSTM) which attempts to learn the semantics the program.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The quite naive method of learning makes this paper not a favorable candidate for acceptance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"This is an interesting and pleasant paper on superoptimization, that extends the  problem approached by the stochastic search STOKE to a learned stochastic search, where the STOKE proposals are the output of a neural network which takes some program embedding as an input.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The authors then use REINFORCE to learn an MCMC scheme with the objective of minimizing the final program cost.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The writing is clear and results highlight the efficacy of the method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,comments / questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"Am I correct in understanding that of the entire stochastic computation graph, only the features->proposal part is learned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The rest is still effectively the stoke MCMC scheme?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Does that imply that the 'uniform' model is effectively Stoke and is your baseline (this should probably be made explicit ),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Did the authors consider learning the features instead of using out of the box features (could be difficult given the relatively small amount of data - the feature extractor might not generalize).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"In a different context, 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference:Bridging the Gap' by Salimans et al. suggests considering a MCMC scheme as a stochastic computation graph and optimizing using a variational (i.e. RL) criterion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"The problem is different, it uses HMC instead of MCMC, but it might be worth citing as a similar approach to 'meta-optimized' MCMC algorithms.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Two things I really liked about this paper:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"1. The whole idea of having a data-dependent proposal distribution for MCMC. I wasn't familiar with this, although it apparently was previously published. I went back: the (Zhu, 2000) paper was unreadable. The (Jampani, 2014) paper on informed sampling was good. So, perhaps this isn't a good reason for accepting to ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"2. The results are quite impressive. The rough rule-of-thumb is that optimization can help you speed up code by 10%. The standard MCMC results presented on the paper on randomly-generated programs roughly matches this (15%). The fact that the proposed algorithm get ~33% speedup is quite surprising, and worth publishing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,The argument against accepting this paper is that it doesn't match the goals of ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,I don't go to ICLR to hear about generic machine learning papers (we have NIPS and ICML for that).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"Instead, I go to learn about how to automatically represent data and models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"Now, maybe this paper talks about how to represent (generated) programs, so it tangentially lives under the umbrella of ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,But it will compete against more relevant papers in the conference,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,it may just be a poster.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,Sending this to a programming language conference may have more eventual impact.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1rz6U5lg,"Nonetheless, I give this paper an ""accept"", because I learned something valuable and the results are very good.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,This paper theoretically justified a faster convergence (in terms of average gradient norm attained after processing a fixed number of samples) of using small mini-batches for SGD or ASGD with smaller number of learners.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,This indicates that there is an inherent inefficiency in the speed-up obtained with parallelizing gradient descent methods by taking advantage of hardware.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,This paper looks good overall and makes some connection between algorithm design and hardware properties.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,My main concern is that Lemma 1 looks incorrect to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,The factor D_f / S should be D_f/ (S*M) for me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,Please clarify this and check the subsequent theorem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,"This paper shows that when a larger mini-batch is used (in the serial setting), the number of samples needed to be processed for the same convergence guarantee is larger.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,A similar behavior is discussed for using multiple learners in asynchronous SGD.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,"This behavior has been known in convex optimization (e.g., ""Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods"", NIPS 2011).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,"There, the convergence is of the form O(1/\sqrt{bT}+1/T), and so using bT samples only lead to \sqrt{b} time improvement.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,"Hence, the novelty is limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,The theoretical results in this paper suggest that it is best not to use mini-batch.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,"Hence, the practical significance of the results is also limited.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk_zTU5eg,I find the problem addressed in the paper relevant and the theoretical part clearly written.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,"This is accomplished by examining statistics for the softmax probability for the most likely class; although the score by itself is not a particularly good measure of confidence, the statistics for out-of-domain examples are different enough from in-domain examples to allow these to be identified with some certainty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,My comments appear below:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,"1. As the authors point out, the AUROC/AUPR criterion is threshold independent. As a result, it is not obvious whether the thresholds that would correspond to a certain operating point (say a true positive rate of 10%) would be similar across different data sets. In other words, it would be interesting to know how sensitive the thresholds are to different test sets (or different splits of the test set). This is important if we want to use the thresholds determined on a given held-out set during evaluation on unseen data (where we would need to select a threshold).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,"2. Performance is reported in terms of AUROC/AUPR and models are compared against a random baseline. I think it’s a little hard to look at the differences in AUC/AUPR to get a sense for how much better the proposed classifier is than the random baseline. It would be useful, for example, if the authors could also report how strongly statistically significant some of these differences are (although admittedly they look to be pretty large in most cases).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,"3. In the experiments on speech recognition presented in Section 3.3, I was not entirely clear on how the model was evaluated. In Table 9, for example, is an “example” the entire utterance or just a single (stacked?) speech frame. Assuming that each “example” is an utterance, are the softmax probabilities the probability of the entire phone sequence (obtained by multiplying the local probability estimates from a Viterbi decoding?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,4. I’m curious about the decision to ignore the blank symbol’s logit in Section 3.3. Why is this required?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4TI9xl,"5. As I mentioned in the pre-review question, at least in the speech recognition case, it would have been interesting to compare performance obtained using a simple generative baseline (e.g., GMM-HMM). I think that would serve as a good indication of the ability of the proposed model to detect out-of-domain examples over the baseline.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,And similarly for disk pace.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Parameters reduction is useful only if it leads to a large decrease in space or inference time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,This paper reduces the computational complexity of CNNs by minimizing the recognition loss and a sparsity-promoting penalty term together.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"The authors use ADMM, which is widely used in optimization problems but not used with CNNs before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The paper has a good motivation and well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The experiments show that the proposed approach increases the sparsity in a network as well as increases the performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"As the authors stated, ADMM approach is not guaranteed to converge in non-convex problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The authors used pre-trained networks to mitigate the problem of trapping into a local optimum.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"However, the datasets that are used are very small.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,It would be good to investigate how the proposed approach works on bigger datasets such as ImageNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Authors should compare their results with previous studies that use pruning or sparsity regularizers (Liu et al. (2015); Han et al. (2015); Collins & Kohli (2014)).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"In the discussion section, authors stated that the proposed approach is efficient in training because of the separability property.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Could you elaborate on that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"Lets say this work uses two phases; phase 1 is pre-training a network, phase 2 is using sparsity and performance promoting steps.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Phase 2 also includes fine-tuning the network based on the new sparse structure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,How long does phase 2 take compare to phase 1?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,How many epochs is needed to fine-tune the network?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The paper presents a method for sparsifying the weights of the convolutional,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,filters and fully-connected layers of a CNN without loss of performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Sparsification is achieved by using augmenting the CNN objective function with a regularization term promoting sparisty on groups of weights.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"The authors use ADMM for solving this optimization task, which allows decoupling of the two terms.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The method is technically sound and clearly explained.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The paper is well organised and the ideas presented in a structured manner.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,I believe that sometimes the wording could be improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The proposed method is simple and effective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Using it in combination with other CNN compression techniques such as quantization/encoding is a promising direction for future research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The experimental evaluation is convincing in the sense that the method seems to work well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"The authors do not use state-of-the-art CNNs architectures, but I don't see this a requirement to deliver the message.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"On the other hand, the proposed method is closely related to recent works (as shown in the references posted in the public comment titled ""Comparison with structurally-sparse DNNs using group Lasso), that should be cited and compared against (at least at a conceptual level).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,I will of course consider the authors rebuttal on this matter.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,It would be very important for the authors to comment on the differences between these works and the proposed approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"It seems that both of these references use sparsity regularized training for neural networks, with a very similar formulation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The authors choose to optimize the proposed objective function using ADMM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"It is not clear to me, why this approach should be more effective than proximal gradient descent methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Could you please elaborate on this?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,ADMM is more demanding in terms of memory (2 copies of the parameters need to be stored).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The claimed contributions (Section 5) seem a bit misleading in my opinion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"Using sparsity promoting regularization in the parameters of the model has been used by many works, in particular in the dictionary learning literature but also in the neural network community (as stated above).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"Claims 1,2 and 3, are well understood properties of L1-type regularizers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"As written in the current version of the manuscript, it seems that these are claimed contributions of this particular work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,A discussion on why sparsity sometimes helps improve performance could be interesting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"In the experimental section, the authors mainly concentrate on comparing accuracy vs parameter reduction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"While this is naturally very relevant property to report, it would be also interesting to show more results in terms of speed-up.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,which should also be improved by the proposed approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,Other minor issues:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,"In (3): I think a ""^2"" is missing in the augmented term (the rightmost term).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye9LT8cee,The authors could cite the approach by Han et all for compressing DNNS:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,The proposed regularizer seems to be a particular combination of existing methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"Though the implied connection between nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers is intriguing, in my opinion the empirical performance does not exceed the performance achieved by similar methods by a large enough margin to arrive at a meaningful conclusion.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"The method proposed essential trains neural networks without a traditional nonlinearity, using multiplicative gating by the CDF of a Gaussian evaluated at the preactivation; this is motivated as a relaxation of a probit-Bernoulli stochastic gate.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,Experiments are performed with both.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,The work is somewhat novel and interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,Little is said about why this is preferable to other similar parameterizations of the same (sigmoidal?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,softsign?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,etc.),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,It would be stronger with more empirical interrogation of why this works and exploration of the nearby conceptual space.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"The CIFAR results look okay by today's standards but the MNIST results are quite bad, neural nets were doing better than 1.5% a decade ago and the SOI map results (and the ReLU baseline) are above 2%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"(TIMIT results on frame classification also aren't that interesting without evaluating word error rate within a speech pipeline, but this is a minor point.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"The idea put forth that SOI map networks without additional nonlinearities are comparable to linear functions is rather misleading as they are, in expectation, nonlinear functions of their input.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,Varying an input example by multiplying or adding a constant will not be linearly reflected in the expected output of the network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,In this sense they are more nonlinear than ReLU networks which are at least locally linear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"The plots are very difficult to read in grayscale,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,Approaches like adaptive dropout also have the binary mask as a function of input to a neuron very similar to the proposed approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,"It is not clear, even from the new draft, how the proposed approach differs to Adaptive dropout in terms of functionality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk0MRI5lg,The experimental validation is also not extensive since comparison to SOTA is not included.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,This paper proposes an extension of PixelCNN method that can be conditioned on text and spatially-structured constraints (segmentation / keypoints).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,It is similar to Reed 2016a except the extension is built on top of PixelCNN instead of GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"After reading the author's comment, I realized the argument is not that conditional PixelCNN is much better than conditional GAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I think the authors can add more discussions about pros and cons of each model in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I agree with the other reviewer that some analysis of training and generation time would be helpful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"I understand it takes O(N) instead of O(1) for PixelCNN method to do sampling, but is that the main reason that the experiments can only be conducted in low resolution (32 x 32)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"I also think since there are not quantitative comparisons, it makes more sense to show more visualizations than 3 examples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Overall, the generated results look reasonably good and have enough diversity.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The color mistake is an issue where the author has provided some explanations in the comment.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I would say the technical novelty is incremental since the extension is straightforward and similar to previous work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I lean toward accepting because it is very relevant to ICLR community,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,and it provides a good opportunity for future investigation and comparison between different deep image synthesis methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,This work focuses on conditional image synthesis in the autoregressive framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Based on PixelCNN, it trains models that condition on text as well as segmentation masks or keypoints.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Experiments show results for keypoint conditional synthesis on the CUB (birds) and MHP (human pose) dataset, and segmentation conditional synthesis on MS-COCO (objects).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,This extension to keypoint/segment conditioning is the primary contribution over existing PixelCNN work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Qualitative comparison is made to GAN approaches for synthesis.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"(1) The paper demonstrates additional capabilities for image generation in the autoregressive framework, suggesting that it can keep pace with the latest capabilities of GANs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"(2) Qualitative comparison in Figure 9 suggests that PixelCNN and GAN-based methods may make different kinds of mistakes, with PixelCNN being more robust against introducing artifacts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,(3) Some effort is put forth to establish quantitative evaluation in terms of log-likelihoods (Table 1).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,(1) Comparison to other work is difficult and limited to qualitative results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The qualitative results can still be somewhat difficult to interpret.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I believe supplementary material or an appendix with many additional examples could partially alleviate this problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,(2) The extension of PixelCNN to conditioning on additional data is fairly straightforward.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"This is a solid engineering contribution, but not a surprising new concept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"""First, it allows us to assess whether auto-regressive models are able to match the GAN results of Reed et al. (2016a).""",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Does it, though?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Because the resolution is so bad.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,And resolution limitations aren't addressed until the second-to-last paragraph of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,And Figure 9 only shows 3 results (picked randomly?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Picked to be favorable to PixelCNN?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,That hardly seems conclusive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The segmentation masks and keypoints are pretty strong input constraints.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,It's hard to tell how much coherent object and scene detail is emerging because the resolution is so low.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"For example, the cows in figure 5 look like color blobs, basically.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Any color blob that follows an exact cow segmentation mask will look cow-like.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"The amount of variation is impressive, though.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"How can we assess how much the model is ""replaying"" training data?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Figure 8 tries to get at this, but I wonder how much each of the ""red birds"", for instance, is mostly copied from a particular training example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,I'm unsatisfied with the answers to the pre-review questions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,You didn't answer my questions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The paper would benefit from concrete numbers on training time / epochs and testing time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,You didn't say why you can't make high resolution comparisons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Yes, it's slower at test time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Is it prohibitively slow?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,Or is it slightly inconvenient?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"There really aren't that many comparisons in the paper, anyway, so it if takes an hour to generate a result that doesn't seem prohibitive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"To be clear about my biases: I don't think PixelCNN is ""the right way"" to do deep image generation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Texture synthesis methods used these causal neighborhoods with some success, but only because there wasn't a clear way to do the optimization more globally (Kwatra et al, Texture Optimization for Example-based Synthesis being one of the first alternatives).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,It seems simply incorrect to make hard decisions about what pixel values should be in one part of the image before synthesizing another part of the image (Another texture synthesis strategy to help fight back against this strict causality was coarse-to-fine synthesis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,And I do see some deep image synthesis methods exploring that).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,It seems much more correct to have a deeper network and let all output pixels be conditioned on all other pixels (this conditioning will implicitly emerge at intermediate parts of the network).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"That said, I could be totally wrong, and the advantages stated in the paper could outweigh the disadvantages.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,But this paper doesn't feel very honest about the disadvantages.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"Overall, I think the results are somewhat tantalizing, especially the ability to generate diverse outputs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"But the resolution is extremely low, especially compared to the richness of the inputs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The network gets a lot of hand holding from rich inputs (it does at least learn to obey them).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,The deep image synthesis literature is moving very quickly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyvw0L9el,"The field needs to move on from ""proof of concept"" papers (the first to show a particular result is possible) to more thorough comparisons.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"The paper proposes an approach to learning models that are good for planning problems, using deep netowork architectures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,The key idea is to ensure that models are self-consistent and accurately predict the future.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,The problem of learning good planning models (as opposed to simply good predictive models is really crucial and attempts so far have failed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,This paper is conceptually interesting and provides a valuable perspective on how to achieve this goal.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,Its incorporation of key RL concepts (like discounting and eligibility traces) and the flexibility to learn these is very appealing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Hence, I think it should be accepted.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"This being said, I think the paper does not quite live up to its claims.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,Here are some aspects that need to be addressed (in order of importance):,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"1. Relationship to past work: the proposed representation seems essentially a non-linear implementation of the Horde architecture. It is also very similar in spirit to predictive state representations. Yet these connections are almost not discussed at all. The related work paragraph is very brief and needs expansion to situate the work in the context of other predictive modelling attempts that both were designed to be used for planning and (in the case of PSRs) were in fact successsfully used in planning tasks. Some newer work on learning action-conditional models in Atari games are also not discussed. Situating the paper better in the context of existing model learning would also help understand easier both the motivations and the novel contributions of the work (otherwise, the reader is left to try and elucidate this for themselves, and may come to the wrong conclusion).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"2. The paper needs to provide some insight about the necessity of the recurrent core of the architecture. The ideas are presented nicely in general fashion, yet the proposed impolementation is quite specific and ""bulky"" (very high number of parameters). Is this really necessary in all tasks? Can one implement the basic ideas outside of the particular architecture proposed? Can we use feedforward approximations or is the recurrent part somehow necessary? At the very least the paper should expand the discussion on this topic, if not provide some empirical evidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"3. The experiments are very restricted in their setup: iid data drawn from fixed distributions, correct targets. So, the proposed approach seems like an overkill for these particular tasks. There is an indirect attempt to provide evidence the learned models would be useful for planning, but no direct measurement to support this'd claim (no use of the models in planning). Compared to the original Horde paper, fewer predictions are learned, and these are more similar to each other. While I sympathize with the desire to go in steps, I think the paper stops short of where it should. At the very least, doing prediction in the context of an actual RL prediction task, with non-iid inputs, should be included in the paper. This should only require minor modifications to the experiments (same task, just different data). Ideally, in the case of the mazes, the learned models should be used in some form of simplified planning to learn paths. This would align the experiments much better with the claims in the presentation of the architecture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"I think there may be a nice paper to made from this, but as it is, it should not be accepted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"The authors describe a new architecture for regression, inspired by techniques for estimating the value function of an Markov reward process.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"The connection is interesting, and there is certainly merit in the idea.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"However, the writing is confusing,  and as far as I can tell, the experiments and discussion are inadequate.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"It is quite possible that I am misunderstanding some things, so I am not putting high confidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Because of all the discussion of MRP's and the background that inspired the model, it is difficult to see that the authors are in a pure, i.i.d. regression setting, where they sample inputs i.i.d.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"(with deterministic outputs given the input) from a distribution, and try to match  a parameterized function to the input output pairs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Because they are in this setting, there is a lot lacking from the experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"For example, they report l2 loss on the maze problem; but not ""percent correct""; indeed, it looks like the deep net with skips goes to about .001 average l2 loss on the 0-1 output maze problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"This is an issue because because it suggests that by simply thresholding the outputs, you could get nearly perfect results, which would point to a model specification error of the baseline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,Are there sigmoids at the end of the baseline plain deep network?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,Note that the proposed models do have sigmoids in the outputs in the multiplicative weightings.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,How do the number of parameters of the proposed network compare to the baselines?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Is the better performance (and again, better is really marginal if I am understanding the way loss is measured) simply an issue of modeling power (perhaps because of the multiplicative connections of the proposed model vs. the baseline)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Because the input is taken i.i.d and the test distribution exactly matches the train, this is an important part of the discussion.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkJsCIcgl,"Moreover, there do not seem to be experiments where the size of the training set is fixed- the axis in the graphs is number of samples seen, which is tied to the number of optimization steps.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,The paper is a little disorganised and somewhat contradictory in parts.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"For example, I find the first sentence in section 2 (MusicNet) would better be pushed one paragraph below so that the section be allowed to begin with a survey of the tools available to researchers in music.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"Also, the description for Table 3 should probably appear somewhere in the Methods section.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"Last example: the abstract/intro says the purpose is note prediction; later (4th paragraph of intro) there's a claim that the focus is ""learning low-level features of music....""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,I find this slightly disorienting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"Although others (Uehara et al., 2016, for example) have discussed collection platforms and corpora, this work is interesting because of its size and the approach for generating features.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"I'm interested in what the authors will to do expand the offerings in the corpus, both in terms of volume and diversity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"The paper introduces a new dataset called MusicNet (presumably analogous to ImageNet), featuring dense ground truth labels for 30+ hours of classical music, which is provided as raw audio.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,Such a dataset is extremely valuable for music information retrieval (MIR) research and a dataset of this size has never before been publicly available.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"It has the potential to dramatically increase the impact of modern machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) in this field, whose adoption has previously been hampered by a lack of available datasets that are large enough.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"The paper also features some ""example"" experiments using the dataset, which I am somewhat less excited about.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,The authors decided to focus on one single task that is not particularly challenging: identifying pitches in isolated segments of audio.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,Pitch information is a fairly low-level characteristic of music.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"Considering that isolated fragments are used as input, this is a relatively simple problem that probably doesn't even require machine learning to solve adequately, e.g. peak picking on a spectral representation could already get you pretty far.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"It's not clear what value the machine learning component in the proposed approach actually adds, if any.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"I would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"As it stands, I feel that the fact that the experiments are relatively uninteresting detracts from the main point of the paper, which is to introduce a new public dataset that is truly unique in terms of its scale and scope.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"That said, the experiments seem to have been conducted in a rigorous fashion and the evaluation and analysis of the resulting models is properly executed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"Re: Section 4.5, it is rather unsurprising to me that a pitch detector would learn filters that resemble pitches (i.e. sinusoids), although the observation that this requires a relatively large amount of data is interesting.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFBJv9gg,"The authors favourably compare the features learnt by their model with prior work on end-to-end learning from raw audio, but neglect that the tasks considered in this work were much more high-level.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,This paper proposes an approach to learning word vector representations for character sequences and acoustic spans jointly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,The paper is clearly written and both the approach and experiments seem reasonable in terms of execution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,The motivation and tasks feel a bit synthetic as it requires acoustics spans for words that have already been segmented from continuous speech - - a major assumption.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,The evaluation tasks feel a bit synthetic overall and in particular when evaluating character based comparisons it seems there should also be phoneme based comparisons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,There's a lot of discussion of character edit distance relative to acoustic span similarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,It seems very natural to also include phoneme string edit distance in this discussion and experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,This is especially true of the word similarity test.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,Rather than only looking at levenshtein edit distance of characters you should evaluate edit distance of the phone strings relative to the acoustic embedding distances.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,Beyond the evaluation task the paper would be more interesting if you compared character embeddings with phone string embeddings.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,I believe the last function could remain identical it's just swapping out characters for phones as the symbol set.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,finally in this topic the discussion and experiments should look at homophones As if not obvious what the network would learn to handle these.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,the vocabulary size and training data amount make this really a toy problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,although there are many pairs constructed most of those pairs will be easy distinctions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,the experiments and conclusions would be far stronger with a larger vocabulary and word segment data set with subsampling all pairs perhaps biased towards more difficult or similar pairs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,it seems this approach is unable to address the task of keyword spotting in longer spoken utterances.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,If that's the case please add some discussion as to why you are solving the problem of word embeddings given existing word segmentations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxDkvqee,The motivating example of using this approach to retrieve words seems flawed if a recognizer must be used to segment words beforehand,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy6iJDqlx,+The experiments are cleverly designed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy6iJDqlx,An important aspect of transfer learning is that the algorithm can automatically figure out if the existing solutions to known tasks are sufficient to solve the novel task so that it can save the time and energy of learning-from-scratch.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,Initial review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,The paper demonstrates an application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to unsupervised feature learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,The authors show that the representation learned by the discriminator of a conditional GAN trained for image inpainting performs well on image classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,"As a side-effect, fairly convincing inpaintings are produced.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,The proposed method combines two existing ideas: using the discriminator of a GAN as a feature learner [Radford et al. 2015] and performing unsupervised feature learning with image inpainting,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,[Pathak et al. 2016].,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,1) Experimental evaluation on Pascal VOC is not quite satisfactory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,Comparison with prior work is unfair because the network architecture used by the authors (VGG) is different from the architecture used by all existing methods (AlexNet).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ--gPcxl,"It is great that the authors do not try to hide this fact in the paper, but I do not understand why the authors are not willing to simply run their method with AlexNet architecture, although two commenters asked them to do so.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,"Paper is well written, but does require domain knowledge to understand.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,My main concerns were well addressed by the rebuttal and corresponding revisions to the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,The paper looks at the problem of transferring a policy learned in a simulator to  a target real-world system.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,"The proposed approach considers using an ensemble of simulated source domains, along with adversarial training, to learn a robust policy that is able to generalize to several target domains.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,"Overall, the paper tackles an interesting problem, and provides a reasonable solution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,The notion of adversarial training used here does not seem the same as other recent literature (e.g. on GANs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,"It would be useful to add more details on a few components, as discussed in the question/response round.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWvgP5el,"I also encourage including the results with alternative policy gradient subroutines, even if they don’t perform well (e.g. Reinforce), as well as results with and without the baseline on the value function.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,This paper proposes the RIMs that unrolls variational inference procedure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"The author claims that the novelty lies in the separation of the model and inference procedure, making the MAP inference as an end-to-end approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,The effectiveness is shown in image restoration experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"While unrolling the inference is not new, the author does raise an interesting perspective towards the `model-free' configuration, where model and inference are not separable and can be learnt jointly.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,However I do not quite agree the authors' argument regarding [1] and,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,[2].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,Although both [1] and [2] have pre-defined MAP inference problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,It is not necessarily that a separate step is required.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"In fact, both do not have either a pre-defined prior model or an explicit prior evaluation step as shown in Fig. 1(a).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"I believe that the implementation of both follows the same procedure as the proposed, that could be explained through Fig. 1(c).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"That is to say, the whole inference procedure eventually becomes a learnable neural network and the energy is implicitly defined through learning the parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Moreover, the RNN block architecture (GRU) and non-linearity (tanh) restrict the flexibility and implicitly form the inherent family of variational energy and inference algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,This is also similar with [1] and,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,[2].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Based on that fact, I have the similar feeling with R1 that the novelty is somewhat limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,Also some discussions should be added in terms of the architecture and nonlinearity that you have chosen.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Unfortunately, even after reading the authors' response to my pre-review question, I feel this paper in its current form lacks sufficient novelty to be accepted to ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Fundamentally, the paper suggests that traditional iterative algorithms for specific class of problems (ill-posed image inverse problems) can be replaced by discriminatively trained recurrent networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"As R3 also notes, un-rolled networks for iterative inference aren't new: they've been used to replace CRF-type inference, and _also_ to solve image inverse problems (my refs",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,[1-3]).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Therefore, I'd argue that the fundamental idea proposed by the paper isn't new",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"it is just that the paper seeks to 'formalize' it as an approach for inverse problems (although, there is nothing specific about the analysis that ties it to inverse problems: the paper only shows that the RIM can express gradient descent over prior + likelihood objective).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,I also did not find the claims about benefits over prior approaches very compelling.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,The comment about parameter sharing works both ways,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"it is possible that untying the parameters leads to better performance over a fewer number of 'iterations', and given that the 'training set' is synthetically generated, learning a larger number of parameters doesn't seem to be an issue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"Also, I'd argue that sharing the parameters is the 'obvious' approach, and the prior methods choose to not tie the parameters to get better accuracy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,The same holds for being able to handle different noise levels / scale sizes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,A single model can always be trained to handle multiple forms of degradation,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,its just that its likely to do better when it's trained for specific degradation model/level.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"But more importantly, there is no evidence in the current set of experiments that shows that this is a property of the RIM architecture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"(Moreover, this claim goes against one of the motivations of the paper of not training a single prior for different observation models ... but to train the entire inference architecture end-to-end).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,It is possible that the proposed method does offer practical benefits beyond prior work,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"but these benefits don't come from the idea of simply unrolling iterations, which is not novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,I would strongly recommend that the authors consider a significant re-write of the paper,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"with a detailed discussion of prior work mentioned in the comments that highlights, with experiments, the specific aspects of their recurrent architecture that enables better recovery for inverse problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"I would also suggest that to claim the mantle of 'solving inverse problems', the paper consider a broader set of inverse tasks",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,"in-painting, deconvolution, different noise models, and possibly working with multiple observations (like for HDR).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,This paper presents a method to learn both a model and inference procedure at the same time with recurrent neural networks in the context of inverse problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,The proposed method is interesting and results are quite good.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,The paper is also nicely presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkSOlP9lg,I would be happy to see some discussion about what the network learns in practice about natural images in the case of denoising.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,It is also shown that the proposed prediction architecture can be used to improve exploration in a 3D environment.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,Novelty,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,The novelty of the proposed architecture is not strong.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,The difference between [Oh et al.],0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,1. modification to model architecture (used in Oh et al.) by using action at time t-1 to directly predict hidden state at t,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,2. exploring the idea of jumpy predictions (predictions multiple frames in future without using intermediate frames),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,3. exploring different training schemes (trade-off between observation and prediction frames for training LSTM),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,1. modification to model architecture,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,The motivation seems good that in past work (Oh et al.),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,"the action at t-1 influences x_t, but not the state h_t of the LSTM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,This could be fixed by making the LSTM state h_t dependent on a_{t-1},0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,"However, this is of minor technical novelty.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,"While the authors claim that combining a_t-1 with h_t-1 and s_t-1 performs worse than the current method which combines a_t-1 only with h_t-1, I would have liked to see the empirical difference in combining a_t-1 only with s_t-1 or only with h_t-1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1s6xvqlx,"Also, a stronger motivation is required to support the current formulation.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"1. How does a model without dense connections perform, i.e. what is the effect of dense connections? To illustrate dense connections, the authors might draw them in figure 1 and refer to it in section 2.1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"2. The run-time results shown in figure 4 are very helpful, but as far as I understood, the breakdown shown on the left side was measured for language modeling (referred in 3.2), whereas the dependency on batch- and sequence size shown on the right side for sentiment classification (referred in 3.1). I suggest to consistently show the results for either sentiment classification or language modeling, or both. At the very least, the figure caption should describe the task explicitly. Labeling the left and right figure by a) and b) would further improve readability.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"3. Section 3.1 describes a high speed-up for long sequences and small batch sizes. I suggest motivating why this is the case. While computations can be parallelized along the sequence length, it is less obvious why smaller batch sizes speed-up computations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"4. The proposed encoder-decoder attention is different from traditional attention in that attention vectors are not computed and used as input to the decoder sequentially, but on top of decoder output states in parallel. This should be described and motivated in the text.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,Sentiment classification,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"5. What was the size of the hold-out development set and how was it created? The text describes that data were split equally into training and test set, without describing the hold-out set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,6. What was the convolutional filter size?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"7. What is the speed-up for the best hyper-parameters (batch size 24, sequence length 231)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"8. Figure 3 would be easier to interpret by actually showing the text on the y-axis. For the sake of space, one might use a smaller text passage, plot it along the x-axis, and show the activations of fewer neurons along the y-axis. Showing more examples in the appendix would make the authors’ claim that neurons are interpretable even more convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,Language modeling,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"9. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"10. What was the convolutional filter size, denoted as ‘k’?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,11. Is it correct that a very high learning rate of 1 was used for six epochs at the beginning?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,12. The authors should show learning curves for a models with and without zone-out.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,Translation,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"13. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,14. How does translation performance depend on k?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"This paper points out that you can take an LSTM and make the gates only a function of the last few inputs  - h_t = f(x_t, x_{t-1}, ...x_{t-T}) - instead of the standard - h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"-, and that if you do so the networks can run faster and work better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,You're moving compute from a serial stream to a parallel stream and also making the serial stream more parallel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"Unfortunately, this simple, effective and interesting concept is somewhat obscured by confusing language.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,I would encourage the authors to improve the explanation of the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,"Another improvement might be to explicitly go over some of the big Oh calculations, or give an example of exactly where the speed improvements are coming from.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,Otherwise the experiments seem adequate and I enjoyed this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1zJ-v5xl,This could be a high value contribution and become a standard neural network component if it can be replicated and if it turns out to work reliably in multiple settings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The paper introduces a novel memory mechanism for NTMs based on differentiable Lie groups.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"This allows to place memory elements as points on a manifold, while still allowing training with backpropagation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"It's a more general version of the NTM memory, and possibly allows for training a more efficient addressing schemes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,novel and interesting idea for memory access,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,nicely written,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,need to manually specify the Lie group to use (it would be better if network could learn the best way of accessing memory),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,not clear if this really works better than standard NTM (compared only to simplified version),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,not clear if this is useful in practice (no comparison on real tasks),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The Neural Turing Machine and related “external memory models” have demonstrated an ability to learn algorithmic solutions by utilizing differentiable analogues of conventional memory structures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"In particular, the NTM, DNC and other approaches provide mechanisms for shifting a memory access head to linked memories from the current read position.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The NTM, which is the most relevant to this work, uses a differentiable version of a Turing machine tape.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The controller outputs a kernel which “softly” shifts the head, allowing the machine to read and write sequences.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"Since this soft shift typically “smears” the focus of the head, the controller also outputs a sharpening parameter which compensates by refocusing the distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The premise of this work is to notice that while the NTM emulates a differentiable version of a Turing tape, there is no particular reason that one is constrained to follow the topology of a Turing tape.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Instead they propose memory stored at a set of points on a manifold and shift actions which form a Lie group.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"In this way, memory points can have have different relationships to one another, rather than being constrained to Z.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,This is mathematically elegant and here they empirically test models with the shift group R^2 acting on R^2 and the rotation group acting on a sphere.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"Overall, the paper is well communicated and a novel idea.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The primary limitation of this paper is its limited impact.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"While this approach is certainly mathematically elegant, even likely beneficial for some specific problems where the problem structure matches the group structure, it is not clear that this significantly contributes to building models capable of more general program learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"Instead, it is likely to make an already complex and slow model such as the NTM even slower.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"In general, it would seem memory topology is problem specific and should therefore be learned rather than specified.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The baseline used for comparison is a very simple model, which does not even having the sharpening (the NTM approach to solving the problem of head distributions becoming ‘smeared’).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"There is also no comparison with the successor to the NTM, the DNC, which provides a more general approach to linking memories based on prior memory accesses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Minor issues:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Footnote on page 3 is misleading regarding the DNC.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"While the linkage matrix explicitly excludes the identity, the controller can keep the head in the same position by gating the following of the link matrix.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Figures on page 8 are difficult to follow.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The paper proposes a new memory access scheme based on Lie group actions for NTMs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* Well written,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* Novel addressing scheme as an extension to NTM.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* Seems to work slightly better than normal NTMs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* Some interesting theory about the novel addressing scheme based on Lie groups.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"* In the results, the LANTM only seems to be slightly better than the normal NTM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* The result tables are a bit confusing.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The difference to the properties of normal NTM doesn't become too clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Esp it is said that LANTM are better than NTM because they are differentiable end-to-end and provide a robust relative indexing scheme but NTM are also differentiable end-to-end and also provide a robust indexing scheme.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,* It is said that the head is discrete in NTM,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"but actually it is in space R^n, i.e. it is already continuous.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,It doesn't become clear what is meant here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,No comparisons to some of the other NTM extensions such as D-NTM or Sparse Access Memory (SAM) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09027).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"Although the motivations of other NTM extensions might be different, such comparisons still would have been interesting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*** Paper Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,This paper formalizes the properties required for addressing (indexing) memory augmented neural networks as well as how to pair the addressing with read/write operation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,It then proposes a framework in which any Lie group as the addressing space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Experiments on algorithmic tasks are reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*** Review Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,This paper brings unity and formalism in the requirement for memory addressing while maintaining differentiable memories.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,Its proposal provide a generic scheme to build addressing mechanisms.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"When comparing the proposed approach with key-value networks, the unbounded number of memory cells and the lack of incentive to reuse indexes might reveal impractical.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,*** Detailed Review ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The paper reads well, has appropriate relevance to related work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,The unified presentation of memory augmented networks is clear and brings unity to the field.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,"The proposed approach is introduced clearly, is powerful and gives a tool that can be reused after reading the article.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,I do not appreciate that the growing memory is not mentioned as a drawback.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byiy-Pqlx,It should be stressed and a discussion on the impact it has on efficiency/scalability is needed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"1. the QA model is not novel, very similar to the existing model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"2. The IQA model is very confusing. If it needs human interactive in the training process, how could it be practical to ask human to join the training in each iteration? It sounds impractical. If the human interactive questions are predefined, then it is not interactive at all, since it is not based on the current state of model output.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,This work describes,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"1: a two stage encoding of stories in bAbI like setups, where a GRU is used to encode a sentence, word by word, conditioned on a sentence level GRU, and the sentence level GRU keeps track of a sentence level encoding.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,Each is used,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,2: modifying the bAbI tasks so it is necessary to ask a question to correctly solve the problem,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,I am not convinced by the papers results:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"1:   The new architecture does not do significantly better than DMN+, and in my view, is similar to DMN+.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,What problem with DMN+ does your architecture solve?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"2:  There are now several papers doing the second thing, for example ""Dialog-based Language Learning"" by Weston and  ""Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog"" by Bordes and Weston, and I think doing it more carefully and in more compelling ways.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"In the current work, the correct answer to the question seems given independent of the what the agent asks, so any model that can output ""unknown"" and then input the extra response has an advantage.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,Essentially all of the architectures that are used to solve bAbI can be modified to do this...,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"Indeed, the enc-dec* accuracies in appendix A show that this sort of module can be appended to any other model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,All of the standard models can be trained to output questions as a sequence of words.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"Furthermore, I suspect you could generate the questions  in the authors' setting just by enumerating all the questions that occur in training, and taking a softmax over them, instead of generating word-by-word.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"This paper proposes an ""interactive"" version of the bAbI dataset by adding supporting questions/answers to the dataset in cases where there is not enough information to answer the question.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,Interactive QA is certainly an interesting problem and is well-motivated by the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"However, I don't feel like the bAbI extension is adequately explained.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"For example, the baseline DMN and MemN2N models on the IQA task are ""take both statements and question as input and then",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"estimate an answer.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"Their task is then fundamentally more difficult from the CAN's because they do not distinguish ""feedback"" from the original context; perhaps a more fair approach would be to treat **every** question (both supporting and original questions) as individual instances.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"Also, how were the supporting questions and the user feedback generated?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,How many templates / words were used to create them?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"The dataset creation details are missing, and if space is an issue, a lot of basic exposition on things like GRU / sentence encodings can be cut (or at least greatly shortened) and replaced with pointers to the original papers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"Another issue I had is that the model attempts to generate these synthetic questions; if there are just one or two templates, why not just predict the values that fill these templates?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"So instead of generating ""Which bedroom, master one or guest one?"" with an RNN decoder, just predict ""which"" or ""which bedroom""... isn't this sufficient?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"In the end, these just seem like more supporting facts, not actual interaction with users, and the fact that it is run on only three of the original twenty tasks make the conclusions hard to trust.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkyQWDcex,"In conclusion, I think the paper has a strong idea and motivation, but the experiments are not convincing for the paper to be accepted at ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,This was an interesting paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"The algorithm seems clear, the problem well-recognized, and the results are both strong and plausible.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Approaches to hyperparameter optimization based on SMBO have struggled to make good use of convergence during training, and this paper presents a fresh look at a non-SMBO alternative (at least I thought it did, until one of the other reviewers pointed out how much overlap there is with the previously published successive halving algorithm - too bad!).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Still, I'm excited to try it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I'm cautiously optimistic that this simple alternative to SMBO may be the first advance to model search for the skeptical practitioner since the case for random search > grid search (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html, which this paper should probably cite in connection with their random search baseline.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I would suggest that the authors remove the (incorrect?) claim that this algorithm is ""embarrassingly parallel"" as it seems that there are number of synchronization barriers at which state must be shared in order to make the go-no-go decisions on whatever training runs are still in progress.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"As the authors themselves point out as future work, there are interesting questions around how to adapt this algorithm to make optimal use of a cluster (I'm optimistic that it should carry over, but it's not trivial).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"For future work, the authors might be interested in Hutter et al's work on Bayesian Optimization With Censored Response Data (https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1947) for some ideas about how to use the dis-continued runs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"This paper discusses Hyperband, an extension of successive halving by Jamieson & Talwalkar (AISTATS 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,Successive halving is a very nice algorithm that starts evaluating many configurations and repeatedly cuts off the current worst half to explore many configuration for a limited budget.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Having read the paper for the question period and just rereading it again, I am now not entirely sure what its contribution is meant to be: the only improvement of Hyperband vs. successive halving is in the theoretical worst case bounds (not more than 5x worse than random search), but you can (a) trivially obtain that bound by using a fifth of your time for running random configurations to completion and (b) the theoretical analysis to show this is said to be beyond the scope of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"That makes me wonder whether the theoretical results are the contribution of this paper, or whether they are the subject of a different paper and the current paper is mostly an empirical study of the method?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I hope to get a response by the authors and see this made clearer in an updated version of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"In terms of experiments, the paper fails to show a case where Hyperband actually performs better than the authors' previous algorithm successive halving with its most agressive setting of bracket b=4.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Literally, in every figure, bracket b=4 is at least as good (and sometimes substantially better) than Hyperband.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,That makes me think that in practice I would prefer successive halving with b=4 over Hyperband.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,(And if I really want Hyperband's guarantee of not being more than 5x worse than random search I can run random search on a fifth of my machines.),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"The experiments also compare to some Bayesian optimization methods, but not to the most relevant very closely related Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization methods that have been dominating effective methods for deep learning in that area in the last 3 years: ""Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization"" by Swersky, Snoek, and Adams (2013) already showed 5x speedups for deep learning by starting with smaller datasets, and there have been several follow-up papers showing even larger speedups.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Given that this prominent work on multitask Bayesian optimization exists, I also think the introduction, which sells Hyperband as a very new approach to hyperparameter optimization is misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I would've much preferred a more down-to-earth pitch that says ""configuration evaluation"" has been becoming a very important feature in hyperparameter optimization, including Bayesian optimization, that sometimes yields very large speedups (this can be quantified by examples from existing papers) and this paper adds some much-needed theoretical understanding to this and demonstrates how important configuration evaluation is even in the simplest case of being used with random search.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I think this could be done easily and locally by adding a paragraph to the intro.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"As another point regarding novelty, I think the authors should make clear that approaches for adaptively deciding how many resources to use for which evaluation have been studied for (at least) 23 years in the ML community",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"see Maron & Moore, NIPS 1993: ""Hoeffding Races: Accelerating Model Selection Search for Classification and Function Approximation"" (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/841-hoeffding-races-accelerating-model-selection-search-for-classification-and-function-approximation).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Again, this could be done by a paragraph in the intro.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Overall, I think for this paper having the related work section at the end leads to many concepts appearing to be new in the paper that turn out not to be new in the end, which is a bit of a let-down.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I encourage the authors to prominently discuss related work, including the recent trends in Bayesian optimization towards configuration evaluation, in the beginning, and then clearly state the contribution of this paper by positioning it in the context of that related work and saying what exactly is new.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"(I think the answer is ""very simple method"", ""great empirical results for several deep learning tasks"" and ""much-needed new theoretical results"", which is a very nice contribution.)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I'm giving an accepting score trusting that the authors will follow this suggestion.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I have some responses to some of the author responses:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"1) ""In response to your question, we ran an experiment modeled after the empirical studies in Krueger et al tuning 2 hyperparameters of a kernel SVM to compare CVST (Krueger et al 2015) and Hyperband.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,Hyperband is 3-4x faster than CVST on this experiment and the two achieve similar test performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Notably, CVST was only 50% faster than standard holdout.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"For the experiments in our paper, we excluded CVST due to the aforementioned theoretical differences and because CVST is not an anytime algorithm, but as we perform more experiments, we will update the draft to reflect this comparison.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Great, I am looking forward to seeing the details on these experiments before the decision phase.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"2) ""Hyperband makes no assumptions on the shape or rate of convergence of the validation error, just that it eventually converges.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"It's only the worst-case analysis that makes no assumption, but of course one would not be happy with that worst-case performance of being 5x worse than random search.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"(The 5x is what the authors call ""modestly worse, by a log factor""; it's the logarithm of the dataset size or of the number of epochs, both of which tend to be large numbers).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I think this number of 5x should be stated explicitly somewhere for the authors choice of Hyperband parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"(E.g., at the beginning of the experiments, when Hyperband's parameters are stated.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"3) ""Like random search, it is also embarrassingly parallel.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I think this is not quite correct.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Let's say I want to tune hyperparameters on ImageNet and each hyperparameter evaluation takes 1 week, but I have 100 GPUs, then random search will give a decent solution (the best of 100 random configurations) after 1 week.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"However, Hyperband will require 5 weeks before it will give any solution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Again, the modest log factor is a factor of 5.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"To me, ""embarassingly parallel"" would mean making great predictions after a week if you throw enough resources at it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"This paper presents Hyperband, a method for hyperparameter optimization where the model is trained by gradient descent or some other iterative scheme.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"The paper builds on the successive halving + random search approach of Jamieson and Talwalkar and addresses the tradeoff between training fewer models for a longer amount of time, or many models for a shorter amount of time.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"Effectively, the idea is to perform multiple rounds of successive halving, starting from the most exploratory setting, and then in each round exponentially decreasing the number of experiments, but granting them exponentially more resources.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"In contrast to other recent papers on this topic, the approach here does not rely on any specific model of the underlying learning curves and therefore makes fewer assumptions about the nature of the model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"The results seem to show that this approach can be highly effective, often providing several factors of speedup over sequential approaches.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,Overall I think this paper is a good contribution to the hyperparameter optimization literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"It’s relatively simple to implement, and seems to be quite effective for many problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,It seems like a natural extension of the random search methodology to the case of early stopping.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"To me, it seems like Hyperband would be most useful on problems where a) random search itself is expected to perform well and b) the computational budget is sufficiently constrained so that squeezing out the absolute best performance is not feasible and near-optimal performance is sufficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I would personally like to see the plots in Figure 3 run out far enough that the other methods have had time to converge in order to see what this gap between optimal and near-optimal really is (if there is one).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,I’m not sure I agree with the use of random2x as a baseline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I can see why it’s a useful comparison because it demonstrates the benefit of parallelism over sequential methods, but virtually all of these other methods also have parallel extensions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry18Ww5ee,"I think if random2x is shown, then I would also like to see SMAC2x, Spearmint2x, TPE2x, etc.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,The paper will benefit from more thorough experiments on other neural network architectures where the geometry of the parameter space are sufficiently different than CNNs such as fully connected and recurrent neural networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Neither MNIST nor CIFAR experimental section explained the architectural details,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Comparison with different baseline optimizer such as Adam would be a strong addition or at least explain how the hyper-parameters, such as learning rate and momentum, are chosen for the baseline SGD method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Overall, due to the omission of the experimental details in the current revision, it is hard to draw any conclusive insight about the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,The paper reads well and the idea is new.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Sadly, many details needed for replicating the results (such as layer sizes of the CNNs, learning rates) are missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,The training of the introspection network could have been described in more detail.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Also, I think that a model, which is closer to the current state-of-the-art should have been used in the ImageNet experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,That would have made the results more convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Due to the novelty of the idea, I recommend the paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,I would increase the rating if an updated draft addresses the mentioned issues.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,EDIT: Updated score.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,See additional comment.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"I quite like the main idea of the paper, which is based on the observation in Sec. 3.0 - that the authors find many predictable patterns in the independent evolution of weights during neural network training.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,It is very encouraging that a simple neural network can be used to speed up training by directly predicting weights.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"However the technical quality of the current paper leaves much to be desired, and I encourage the authors to do more rigorous analysis of the approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Here are some concrete suggestions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"The findings in Section 3.0 which motivate the approach, should be clearly presented in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Presently they are stated as anecdotes.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,A central issue with the paper is that the training of the Introspection network I is completely glossed over.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"How well did the training work, in terms of training, validation/test losses?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,How well does it need to work in order to be useful for speeding up training?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,These are important questions for anyone interested in this approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,An additional important issue is that of baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Would a simple linear/quadratic model also work instead of a neural network?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,What about a simple heuristic rule to increase/decrease weights?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,I think it's important to compare to such baselines to understand the complexity of the weight evolution learned by the neural network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"I do not think that default tensorflow example hyperparameters should be used, as mentioned by authors on OpenReview.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,There is no scientific basis for using them.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Instead, first hyperparameters which produce good results in a reasonable time should be selected as the baseline, and then added the benefit of the introspection network to speed up training (and reaching a similar result) should be shown.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,The authors state in the discussion on OpenReview that they also tried RNNs as the introspection network but it didn't work with small state size.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"What does ""didn't work"" mean in this context?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Did it underfit?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,I find it hard to imagine that a large state size would be required for this task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Even if it is, that doesn't rule out evaluation due to memory issues because the RNN can be run on the weights in 'mini-batch' mode.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"In general, I think other baselines are more important than RNN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,A question about jump points:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,The I is trained on SGD trajectories.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"While using I to speed up training at several jump points, if the input weights cross previous jump points, then I gets input data from a weight evolution which is not from SGD (it has been altered by I).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,This seems problematic but doesn't seem to affect your experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,I feel that this again highlights the importance of the baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,Perhaps I is doing something extremely simple that is not affected by this issue.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg8bDqee,"Since the main idea is very interesting, I will be happy to update my score if the above concerns are addressed.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,would there by any alternative solution to combine the different networks/views?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,That could make the proposed solution more novel.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"the experimental settings, especially in the synthetic experiments, should be more detailed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"If possible, the datasets should be made available to encourage reproducibility.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"the related work is far from complete unfortunately, especially from the perspective of the numerous multiview/multi-modal/multi-layer algorithms that have been proposed in the literature, in different applications domaines like image retrieval or classification, or bibliographic data for example (authors like A. Kumar, X. Dong, Ping-Yu Chen, M. Bronstein, and many others have proposed works in that direction in the last 5 years).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"No need to compare to all these works obviously, but a more complete description of the related could help appreciating better the true benefits of DGCCA.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,This paper proposes a deep extension of generalized CCA.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The main contribution of the paper is deriving the gradient update for the GCCA objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,I disagree with the claim that “this is the first Multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent resources or views”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,[R1] proposes a Multiview representation learning method which is both non-linear and capable of handling more than 2 views.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,This is very much relevant to what authors are proposing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The objective function proposed in [R1] maximizes the correlation between views and minimizes the self and cross reconstruction errors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,This is intuitively similar to nonlinear version of PCA+CCA for multiple views.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,Comparing these 2 methods is crucial to prove the usefulness of DGCCA and the paper is incomplete without this comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,Authors should also change their strong claim.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,Related work section is minimal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,There are significant advances in 2-view non-linear representation learning which are worth mentioning.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,HLT-NAACL 2016: 171-181,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The proposed method is simple and elegant; it builds upon the huge success of gradient based optimization for deep non-linear function approximators and combines it with established (linear) many-view CCA methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,A major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the gradients with respect to the non-linear encoding networks which project the different views into a common space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The derivation seems correct.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,In general this approach seems very interesting and I could imagine that it might be applicable to many other similarly structured problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The paper is well written; but it could be enhanced with an explicit description of the complete algorithm which also highlights how the joint embeddings G and U are updated.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,I don’t have prior experience with CCA-style many-view techniques and it is therefore hard for me to judge the practical/empirical progress presented here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,But the experiments seem reasonable convincing; although generally only performed on small and medium sized datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,The colours or the sign of the x-axis in figure 3b seem to be flipped compared to figure 4.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"It would be nice to additionally see a continuous (rainbow-coloured) version for Figures 2, 3 and 4 to better identify neighbouring datapoints; but more importantly: I’d like to see how the average reconstruction error between the individual network outputs and the learned representation develop during training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,Is the mismatch between different views on a validation/test-set a useful metric for cross validation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycUbvcge,"In general, it seems the method is sensitive to regularization and hyperparameter selection  (because it has many more parameters compared to GCCA and different regularization parameters have been chosen for different views) and I wonder if there is a clear metric to optimize these.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,This paper proposes a variant of a recurrent neural network that has two orthogonal temporal dimensions that can be used as a decoder to generate tree structures (including the topology) in an encoder-decoder setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,The architecture is well motivated and I can see several applications (in addition to what's presented in the paper) that need to generate tree structures given an unstructured data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,One weakness of the paper is the limitation of experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"IFTTT dataset seems to be an interesting appropriate application, and there is also a synthetic dataset, however it would be more interesting to see more natural language applications with syntactic tree structures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Still, I consider the experiments sufficient as a first step to showcase a novel architecture.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"A strength is that the authors experiment with different design decisions when building the topology predictor components of the architecture, about when / how to decide to terminate, as opposed to making a single arbitrary choice.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,I see future applications of this architecture and it seems to have interesting directions for future work,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,so I suggest its acceptance as a conference contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,The paper propose DRNN as a neural decoder for tree structures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"I like the model architecture since it has two clear improvements over traditional approaches — (1) the information flows in two directions, both from the parent and from siblings, which is desirable in tree structures (2) the model use a probability distribution to model the tree boundary (i.e. the last sibling or the leaf).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,This avoids the use of special ending symbols which is larger in size and putting more things to learn for the parameters (shared with other symbols).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,The authors test the DRNN using the tasks of recovering the synthetic trees and recovering functional programs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,The model did better than traditional methods like seq2seq models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"I think the recovering synthetic tree task is not very satisfying for two reasons — (1) the surface form itself already containing some of the topological information which makes the task easier than it should be (2) as we can see from figure 3, when the number of nodes grows (even to a number not very large), the performance of the model drops dramatically, I am not sure if a simple baseline only captures the topological information in the surface string would be much worse than this.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"And DRNN in this case, seems can’t show its full potentials since the length of the information flow in the model won’t be very long.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,I think the experiments are interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,But I think there are some other tasks which are more difficult and the tree structure information are more important in such tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"For example, we have the seq2seq parsing model (Vinyals et al, 2014), is it possible to use the DRNN proposed here on the decoder side?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,I think tasks like this can show more potentials of the DRNN and can be very convincing that model architectures like this are better than traditional alternatives.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,Authors' response well answered my questions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,Thanks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,Evaluation not changed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,###,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,This paper proposes a neural model for generating tree structure output from scratch.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"The model does 1) separate the recurrence between depths and siblings; 2) separate the topology and label generation, and outperforms previous methods on a benchmark IFTTT dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Compared to previous tree-decoding methods, the model avoids manually annotating subtrees with special tokens, and thus is a very good alternative to such problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"The paper does solid experiments on one synthetic dataset, and outperforms alternative methods on one real-world IFTTT dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,There are couple of interesting results in the paper that I believe is worth further investigation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Firstly, on the synthetic dataset, the precision drops rapidly with the number of nodes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Is it because that the vector representation of the sequential encoder fails to provide sufficient information of long sequences, such that the tree decoder can not do a good job?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Or is it because that such tree decoder is not tolerant to the long sequence input, i.e., large tree structure?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,I believe that it is important to understand this before a better model can be developed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"For example, if it is the fault of encoder, maybe an attention layer can be added, as in a seq-to-seq model, to preserve more information of the input sequence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Moreover, besides only showing how the precision changes with the number of nodes in the tree, it might be interesting to investigate how it goes with 1) number of depths; 2) number of widths; 3) symmetricity; etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"Moreover, as greedy search is used in decoding, it might be interesting to see how it helps, if it does, to use beam-search in tree decoding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"On the IFTTT dataset, listing more statistics about this dataset might be helpful for better understanding the difficulty of this task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,How deep are the trees?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,How large are the vocabularies on both language and program sides?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"The paper is well written, except for minor typo as mentioned in my pre-review questions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,"In general, I believe this is a solid paper, and more can be explored in this direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkYhZDqxg,So I tend to accept it.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,The paper addresses an important problem - namely on how to improve diversity in responses.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,It is applaudable that the authors show results on several tasks showing the applicability across different problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,In my view there are two weaknesses at this point,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,1) the improvements (for essentially all tasks) seem rather minor and do not really fit the overall claim of the paper,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,2) the approach seems quite ad hoc and it unclear to me if this is something that will and should be widely adopted.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,Having said this the gist of the proposed solution seems interesting but somewhat premature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,[ Summary ],1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,This paper presents a new modified beam search algorithm that promotes diverse beam candidates.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"It is a well known problem —with both RNNs and also non-neural language models— that beam search tends to generate beam candidates that are very similar with each other, which can cause two separate but related problems: (1) search error: beam search may not be able to discover a globally optimal solution as they can easily fall out of the beam early on, (2) simple, common, non-diverse output: the resulting output text tends to be generic and common.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,This paper aims to address the second problem (2) by modifying the search objective function itself so that there is a distinct term that scores diversity among the beam candidates.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"In other words, the goal of the presented algorithm is not to reduce the search error of the original objective function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"In contrast, stack decoding and future cost estimation, common practices in phrase-based SMT, aim to address the search error problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,[ Merits ],1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,I think the Diverse Beam Search (DBS) algorithm proposed by the authors has some merits.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"It may be useful when we cannot rely on traditional beam search on the original objective function either because the trained model is not strong enough, or because of the search error, or because the objective itself does not align with the goal of the application.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,[ Weaknesses ],0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"It is however not entirely clear how the proposed method compares against more traditional approaches like stack decoding and future cost estimation, on tasks like machine translation, as the authors compare their algorithm mainly against L&J’s diverse LM models and simple beam search.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"In fact, modification to the objective function has been applied even in the neural MT context.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"For example, see equation (14) in page 12 of the following paper:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"""Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation"" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144v2.pdf)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"where the attention coverage term serves a role similar to stack decoding (though unlike stack decoding, the objective term is entirely re-defined, more similarly to DBS proposed in this work), and the length penalty may have an effect that indirectly promotes more informative (thus more likely diverse) responses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,Comparison against these existing algorithms would make the proposed work more complete.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"Also, I have a mixed feeling about computing and reporting only *oracle* BLUE, CIDEr, METEOR, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"Especially given how these oracle scores are very close to each other, and that developing a high performing ranking has not been addressed in this work (and that doing so must be not all that trivial), I’m somewhat skeptical how much of DBS results make a practical difference.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,[Update after the author responses] ****,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,The authors addressed some of my concerns by adding a new baseline comparison against Wu et al. 2016.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,Thus I will raise my score to 6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,This paper considers the problem of decoding diverge solutions from neural sequence models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"It basically adds an additional term to the log-likelihood of standard neural sequence models, and this additional term will encourage the solutions to be diverse.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"In addition to solve the inference, this paper uses a modified beam search.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"On the plus side, there is not much work on producing diverse solutions in RNN/LSTM models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,This paper represents one of the few works on this topic.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,And this paper is well-written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,The novel of this paper is relatively small.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,There has been a lot of prior work on producing diverse models in the area of probailistic graphical models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,Most of them introduce an additional term in the objective function to encourage diversity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"From that perspective, the solution proposed in this paper is not that different from previous work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"Of course, one can argue that most previous work focues on probabilistic graphical models, while this paper focuses on RNN/LSTM models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"But since RNN/LSTM can be simply interpreted as a probabilistic model, I would consider it a small novelty.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"The diverse beam search seems to straightforward, i.e. it partitions the beam search space into groups, and does not consider the diversity within group (in order to reduce the search space).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"To me, this seems to be a simple trick.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"Note most previous work on diverse solutions in probabilistic graphical models usually involve developing some nontrivial algorithmic solutions, e.g. in order to achieve efficiency.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"In comparison, the proposed solution in this paper seems to be simplistic for a paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"The experimental results how improvement over previous methods (Li & Jurafsky, 2015, 2016).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"But it is hard to say how rigorous the comparisons are, since they are based on the authors' own implementation of (Li & Jurasky, 2015, 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJV1zP5xg,"update: given that the authors made the code available (I do hope the code will remain publicly available), this has alleviated some of my concerns about the rigor of the experiments.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,This paper proposes a method for significantly increasing the number of parameters in a single layer while keeping computation in par with (or even less than) current SOTA models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"The idea is based on using a large mixture of experts (MoE) (i.e. small networks), where only a few of them are adaptively activated via a gating network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"While the idea seems intuitive, the main novelty in the paper is in designing the gating network which is encouraged to achieve two objectives: utilizing all available experts (aka importance), and distributing computation fairly across them (aka load).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Additionally, the paper introduces two techniques for increasing the batch-size passed to each expert, and hence maximizing parallelization in GPUs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Experiments applying the proposed approach on RNNs in language modelling task show that it can beat SOTA results with significantly less computation, which is a result of selectively using much more parameters.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Results on machine translation show that a model with more than 30x number of parameters can beat SOTA while incurring half of the effective computation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,I have the several comments on the paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,I believe that the authors can do a better job in their presentation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"The paper currently is at 11 pages (which is too long in my opinion), but I find that Section 3.2 (the crux of the paper) needs better motivation and intuitive explanation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"For example, equation 8 deserves more description than currently devoted to it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Additional space can be easily regained by moving details in the experiments section (e.g. architecture and training details) to the appendix for the curious readers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Experiment section can be better organized by finishing on experiment completely before moving to the other one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"There are also some glitches in the writing, e.g. the end of Section 3.1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,The paper is missing some important references in conditional computation (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3432.pdf) which deal with very similar issues in deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"One very important lesson from the conditional computation literature is that while we can in theory incur much less computation, in practice (especially with the current GPU architectures)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,the actual time does not match the theory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,This can be due to inefficient branching in GPUs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"It would be nice if the paper includes a discussion of how their model (and perhaps implementation) deal with this problem, and why it scales well in practice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Table 1 and Table 3 contain repetitive information, and I think they should be combined in one (maybe moving Table 3 to appendix).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,One thing I do not understand is how does the number of ops/timestep relate to the training time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,This also related to the pervious comment.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Paper Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Elegant use of MoE for expanding model capacity and enabling training large models necessary for exploiting  very large datasets in a computationally feasible manner,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,The effective batch size for training the MoE drastically increased also,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Interesting experimental results on the effects of increasing the number of MoEs, which is expected.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Paper Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,there are many different ways of increasing model capacity to enable the exploitation of very large datasets; it would be very nice to discuss  the use of MoE and other alternatives in terms of computational efficiency and other factors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"This paper describes a method for greatly expanding network model size (in terms of number of stored parameters) in the context of a recurrent net, by applying a Mixture of Experts between recurrent net layers that is shared between all time steps.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"By process features from all timesteps at the same time, the effective batch size to the MoE is increased by a factor of the number of steps in the model; thus even for sparsely assigned experts, each expert can be used on a large enough sub-batch of inputs to remain computationally efficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Another second technique that redistributes elements within a distributed model is also described, further increasing per-expert batch sizes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Experiments are performed on language modeling and machine translation tasks, showing significant gains by increasing the number of experts, compared to both SoA as well as explicitly computationally-matched baseline systems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,An area that falls a bit short is in presenting plots or statistics on the real computational load and system behavior.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"While two loss terms were employed to balance the use of experts, these are not explored in the experiments section.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"It would have been nice to see the effects of these more, along with the effects of increasing effective batch sizes, e.g. measurements of the losses over the course of training, compared to the counts/histogram distributions of per-expert batch sizes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"Overall I think this is a well-described system that achieves good results, using a nifty placement for the MoE that can overcome what otherwise might be a disadvantage for sparse computation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Small comment:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,"I like Fig 3, but it's not entirely clear whether datapoints coincide between left and right plots.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,The H-H line has 3 points on left but 5 on the right?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ckMDqlg,Also would be nice if the colors matched between corresponding lines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The authors propose a simple modification of online dictionary learning: inspired by neurogenesis, they propose to add steps of atom addition, or atom deletion, in order to extent the online dictionary learning algorithm algorithm of Mairal et al.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,Such extensions helps to adapt the dictionary to changing properties of the data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The online adaptation is very interesting, even if it is quite simple.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The overall algorithm is quite reasonable, but not always described in sufficient details: for example, the thresholds or conditions for neuronal birth or death are not supported by a strong analysis, even if the resulting algorithm seems to perform well on quite extensive experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The overall idea is nevertheless interesting (even if not completely new), and the paper generally well written and pretty easy to follow.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The analysis is however quite minimal: it could have been interesting to study the evolving properties of the dictionary, to analyse its accuracy for following the changes in the data, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,Still: this is a nice work!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The paper is interesting, it relates findings from neurscience and biology to a method for sparse coding that is adaptive and able to automatically generate (or even delete) codes as new data is coming, from a nonstationary distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,I have a few points to make:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"1. the algorithm could be discussed more, to give a more solid view of the contribution. The technique is not novel in spirit. Codes are added when they are needed, and removed when they dont do much.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"2. Is there a way to relate the organization of the data to the behavior of this method? In this paper, buildings are shown first, and natural images (which are less structured, more difficult) later. Is this just a way to perform curriculum learning? What happens when data simply changes in structure, with no apparent movement from simple to more complex (e.g. from flowers, to birds, to fish, to leaves, to trees etc)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"In a way, it makes sense to see an improvement when the training data has such a structure, by going from something artificial and simpler to a more complex, less structured domain.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,I am not sure it is ready for publication yet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,I'd like to thank the authors for their detailed response and clarifications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,This work proposes new training scheme for online sparse dictionary learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,The model assumes a non-stationary flow of the incoming data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,The goal (and the challenge) is to learn a model in an online manner in a way that is capable of  adjusting to the new incoming data without forgetting how to represent previously seen data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,The proposed approach deals with this problem by incorporating a mechanism for adding or deleting atoms in the dictionary.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,This procedure is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"The paper has two main innovations over the baseline approach (Mairal et al): (i) “neuronal birth” which represents an adaptive way of increasing the number of atoms in the dictionary (ii) ""neuronal death"", which corresponds to removing “useless” dictionary atoms.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,Neural death is implemented by including an group-sparsity regularization to the dictionary atoms themselves (the group corresponds to a column of the dictionary).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"This promotes to shrink to zero atoms that are not very useful, keeping controlled the increase of the dictionary size.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"I believe that the strong side of the paper is its connections with the adult neurogenesis phenomenon, which is, in my opinion a very nice feature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,The paper is very well written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"On the other hand, the overall technique is not very novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"Although not exactly equivalent, similar ideas have been explored.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"While the neural death is implemente elegantly with a sparsity-promoting regularization term, the neural birth is performed by relying on heuristics that measure how well the dictionary can represent new incoming data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"Which depending on the ""level"" of non-stationarity in the incoming data (or presence of outliers) could be difficult to set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyecJGP5ge,"Still, having adaptive dictionary size is very interesting.",1

If not, what are the different frequencies used and how would this impact the overall system design in terms of feeding the data to the floating point units from the memory",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,"1. I would recommend using the IEEE half-precision floating point (1bit sign, 5bit exponent, and 10bit mantissa) as a baseline for comparison. At this point, it is well known in both the ML and the HW communities that 32-bit floats are an overkill for DNN inference and major HW vendors already include support for IEEE half-precision floats.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,"2. In my opinion, the claim that switching to custom floating point  lead to a YY.ZZ x savings in energy is misleading. It might be true that the floating-point unit itself might consume less energy due to smaller bit-width of the operands, however a large fraction of the total energy is spent in data movement to/from the memories. As a result, reducing the floating point unit’s energy consumption by a certain factor will not translate to the same reduction in the total energy. A reader not familiar with such nuances (for example a typical member of the ML community), may be mislead by such claims.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,"3. On a similar note as comment 2, the authors should explicitly mention that the claimed speedup is that of the floating point unit only, and it will not translate to the overall workload speedup. Although the speedup of the compute unit is roughly quadratic in the bit-width, the bandwidth requirements scale linearly with bit-width. As a result, it is possible that these custom floating point units may be starved on memory bandwidth, in which case the claims of speedup and energy savings need to be revisited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,"4. The authors should also comment on the complexities and overheads introduced in data accesses, designing the various system buses/ data paths when the number representation is not byte-aligned. Moving to a custom 14-bit number representation (for example) can improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the floating point unit, but these gains can be partially eroded due to the additional overhead in supporting non-byte aligned memory accesses.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,Overall there is not a great deal of novelty other than being a useful study on numerical precision trade-offs at neural network test time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,Training time is also something of interest.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_MGwqlg,There are a lot more researchers trying to train new networks fast than trying to evaluate old ones fast.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,The authors of the paper set out to answer the question whether chaotic behaviour is a necessary ingredient for RNNs to perform well on some tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"For that question's sake, they propose an architecture which is designed to not have chaos.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"Instead of proposing another incremental improvement, the authors start out with a clear hypothesis and test it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,This might set the base for future design principles of RNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,The only downside is that the experiments are only conducted on tasks which are known to be not that demanding from a dynamical systems perspective; it would have been nice if the authors had traversed the set of data sets more to find data where chaos is actually necessary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,I think the authors provide an interesting direction for understanding and maybe constructing recurrent models that are easier to interpret.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,This paper poses an interesting idea: removing chaotic behavior or RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"While many other papers on new RNN architecture usually focus too much on the performance improvement and leave the analysis part on their success as a black-box, this paper does a good job on presenting why its method may work well.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"Although, the paper shows lots of comparison between the chaotic systems (GRUs & LSTMs) and the stable system (proposed CFN model), the reviewer is not fully convinced by the main claim of this paper, the nuance that chaotic behaviour makes dynamic system to have rich representation power but makes the system too unstable.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"Taking the idea of this work, can we develop a stable dynamic system, but which does not only have one attractor?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,It is also interesting to see that the layers of CFNs are updated in different timescales in a sense that the decaying speed decreases when the layer gets higher.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1dIzvclg,"For example, what is the average relaxation time of the whole hidden units at each layer?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"To achieve such model, the authors combine VAEs with neural autoregressive models resulting in a model that has both a latent variable structure and a powerful recurrence structure.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,The authors first present an insightful Bits-Back interpretation of VAE to show when and how the latent code is ignored.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"As it was also mentioned in the literature, they say that the autoregressive part of the model ends up explaining all structure in the data, while the latent variables are not used.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,The first one is to make sure the autoregressive decoder only uses small local receptive field so the model has to use the latent code to learn long-range dependency.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,Having a fine-grained control over the kind of information that gets included in the learned representation can be useful for a lot of applications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"For instance, in image retrieval, such learned representation could be used to retrieve objects that have similar shape no matter what texture they have.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"However, the authors say they propose two complementary classes of improvements to VAE, that is the lossy code via explicit information placement (Section 3.1) and learning the prior with autoregressive flow (Section 3.2).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,Its three main contributions are:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,(1) It gives an interesting information-theoretical insight as to why VAE-type models don't tend to take advantage of their latent representation when the conditional distribution on x given z is powerful enough.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,(2) It shows that this insight can be used to efficiently train VAEs with powerful autoregressive conditional distributions such that they make use of the latent code.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,(3) It presents a powerful way to parametrize the prior in the form of an autoregressive flow transformation which is equivalent to using an inverse autoregressive flow transformation on the approximate posterior.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"By itself, I think the information-theoretical explanation of why VAEs do not use their latent code when the conditional distribution on x given z is powerful enough constitutes an excellent addition to our understanding of VAE-related approaches.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"However, the way this intuition is empirically evaluated is a bit weak.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"The ""crippling"" method used feels hand-crafted and very task-dependent, and the qualitative evaluation of the ""lossyness"" of the learned representation is carried out on three datasets (MNIST, OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 Silhouettes) which feature black-and-white images with little-to-no texture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"Figures 1a and 2a do show that reconstructions discard low-level information, as observed in the slight variations in strokes between the input and the reconstruction, but such an analysis would have been more compelling with more complex image datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,Have the authors tried applying VLAE to such datasets?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"I think the Caltech101 Silhouettes benchmark should be treated with caution, as no comparison is made against other competitive approaches like IAF VAE, PixelRNN and Conv DRAW.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,This means that VLAE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in only one of the four settings examined.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"A question which is very relevant to this paper is ""Does a latent representation on top of an autoregressive model help improve the density modeling performance?""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"The paper touches this question, but very briefly: the only setting in which VLAE is compared against recent autoregressive approaches shows that it wins against PixelRNN by a small margin.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,The proposal to transform the latent code with an autoregressive flow which is equivalent to parametrizing the approximate posterior with an inverse autoregressive flow transformation is also interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"There is, however, one important distinction to be made between the two approaches: in the former, the prior over the latent code can potentially be very complex whereas in the latter the prior is limited to be a simple, factorized distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,It is not clear to me that having a very powerful prior is necessarily a good thing from a representation learning point of view: oftentimes we are interested in learning a representation of the data distribution which is untangled and composed of roughly independent factors of variation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,"The degree to which this can be achieved using something as simple as a spherical gaussian prior is up for discussion, but finding a good balance between the ability of the prior to fit the data and its usefulness as a high-level representation certainly warrants some thought.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BysvGP5ee,I would be interested in hearing the authors' opinion on this.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,"The paper presents an interesting framework for image generation, which stitches the foreground and background to form an image.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,This is obviously a reasonable approach there is clearly a foreground object.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,"However, real world images are often quite complicated, which may contain multiple layers of composition, instead of a simple foreground-background layer.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,It would be nice to see if multiple layers of foreground (occluding foregrounds) are ever generated with this layered model or it is just figure-ground aware.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,The authors propose a method that generates naturally looking images by first generating the background and then conditioned on the previous layer one or multiple foreground objects.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,Additionally they add a image transformer layer that allows the model to more easily model different appearances.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,"For MNIST, for example the foreground seems completely irrelevant.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,For CUB and CIFAR of course the fg adds the texture and color while the masks ensures a crisp boundary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,Is the mask a binary mask or a alpha blending mask?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,I find the fact that the model learns to decompose images this nicely and learns to produce crisp foreground masks w/o too much spurious elements (though there are some in CIFAR) pretty fascinating.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,The proposed evaluation metric makes sense and seems reasonable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,"However, AFAICT, theoretically it would be possible to get a high score even though the GAN produces images not recognizable to humans, but only to the classifier network that produces P_g.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ1kmv9xx,Fig 3 shows indeed nicely that the decomposition is much nicer when spatial transformers are used.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"The main idea of conditional biGAN is to matching the latent variable distributions of two encoders, each of which are conditioned on the observation (\tilde{x}) and the output (y), respectively, in addition to standard biGAN formulation.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,We also observe such behavior in digit generation example.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,Preserving attributes like gender is interesting but doesn't seem to be a strong indication that the model learn to correlate observation and the output through latent variable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,This paper builds in the bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) to obtain an extension which can handle multiple views of data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"To this end, the authors extend the BiGAN for multiple view aggregation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,This is an easy task and just requires the introduction of the additional distribution and accompanying discriminator.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,The main challenging and novel part is in regularizing the model to avoid instabilities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,The authors propose a novel KL divergence based constraint.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"As mentioned above, the approach builds quite heavily on previous ones but it has enough novel elements, in particular the constraint for regularization.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,This constraint is a reasonable assumption an in practice seems to work well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,One downside is that it comes with a parameter \lambda which controls its strength and which is not obvious how to find efficiently.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,The experiments presented in the paper are nice illustrations but unfortunately insufficient.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"Firstly, they only cover the task of generating (small) images and correspond to non-real world settings (I'd actually consider all of the experiments as toy experiments).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"Furthermore, the most difficult of these experiments (sec. 5.3) is quite unconvincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgWQPcxl,"If Fig. 6 shows some of the best results that can be achieved, then this is rather disappointing.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,The paper is well written and it elaborately discussed and investigated different approaches for applying sparsity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,The paper contains detailed literature review.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"In result section, it showed the approach gives good results using 60% sparsity with reducing number of parameters, which can be useful in some embedded application with limited resource i.e. mobile devices.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,The main point is that the paper needs more detailed investigation on different dropout schedule.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"As mentioned implementation details section, they deactivate the connections by applying masks to parameter tensors, which is not helpful in speeding up the training and computation in convolution layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,They can optimize implementation to reduce computation time.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,This paper aims to improve efficiency of convolutional networks by using a sparse connection structure in the convolution filters at each layer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"Experiments are performed using MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, comparing the sparse connection kernels against dense convolution kernels with about the same number of connections, showing the sparse structure (with more feature maps) generally performs better for similar numbers of parameters.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"Unfortunately, any theoretical efficiencies are not realized, since the implementation enforces the sparse structure using a zeroing mask on the weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"In addition, although the paper mentions that this method can be implemented efficiently and take advantage of contiguous memory reads/writes of current architectures, I still find it unclear whether this would be the case:  The number of activation units is no smaller than when using a dense convolution of same dimension, and these activations (inputs and outputs) must be loaded/stored.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"The fact that the convolution is sparse saves only on the multiply/addition operation cost, not memory access for the activations, which can often be the larger amount of time spent.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,One of the reasons for that is the unavailability of fast implementations of randomly connected convolutional layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"The results displayed in figures 2, 3, 4, and, 5 show that sparse connections need the same number of parameters as the dense networks to reach to the best performance on the given tasks, but can provide better performance when there is a limited budget for the #parameters and #multiplyAdds.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkC_7v5gx,"This paper is definitely informative but it does not reach to the conference acceptance level, simply because the idea is not new, the sparse connection implementation is poor, and the results are not very surprising.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"One criticism I have of the presentation is that a lot of time and energy is spent setting the table for a method which is claimed to be widely applicable, and the scope of the empirical evaluation is narrowed down to a single specific setting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"In my view, either the paper falls short of its goal of showing how widely applicable the proposed method is, or it spends too much time setting the table for SteinGAN and not enough time evaluating it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,The consequence of this is that the empirical results are insufficient in justifying the approach proposed by the paper.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"This paper considers the energy-based model interpretation of GAN, where the discriminator is an unnormalized model for the likelihood of a generative model p(x|theta) and the generator is a directed model that approximates this distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,The generator is used to draw approximate negative phase samples that are used in stochastic maximum likelihood / contrastive divergence learning of the EBM / discriminator.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,The main idea in the paper is to fit the generator by following the Stein variational gradient.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,In practice this gradient consists of the usual gradient provided by the discriminator with an added term that provides a repulsive force between the sampled data points to increase sample diversity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"The idea of using a kernel to push apart the sampled points is interesting, and will work in low dimensions, but it is hard to see how it can work in full scale images.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"For high dimensional samples x, the proposed kernel is unlikely to provide a useful distance measure between points.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,There are no convincing experiments in the paper that show otherwise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,Specifically:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"There is no experiment that compares between standard GAN and GAN + repulsion, using the same architecture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,(please address this in the rebuttal),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"If the Stein variational idea is taken literally, the right thing to do would be to fully optimize the generator at every step, and then taking a single optimization step on the discriminator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"Instead, each is updated in turn, and the learning rates of both steps are adjusted to keep the two ""in line"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"The kernel used to fit the generator is defined in the auto-encoder space of the discriminator, and thus depends on the discriminator parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"The objective that is used to fit the generator thus changes at every step, and the procedure can no longer be interpreted as stochastic gradient descent with respect to any single well defined objective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,The authors obtain good results: The generated images clearly look better than those generated by DCGAN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"However, their approach has a number of changes compared to DCGAN, so it is not clear where the improvement comes from.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"In addition, by now the DCGAN is no longer a very strong baseline, as various other techniques have been proposed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oRQDqlg,"Note: The use of phi for both the ""particle gradient direction"" and energy function is confusing",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"The authors propose a new software package for probabilistic programming, taking advantage of recent successful tools used in the deep learning community.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"The software looks very promising and has the potential to transform the way we work in the probabilistic modelling community, allowing us to perform rapid-prototyping to iterate through ideas quickly.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"The composability principles are used insightfully, and the extension of inference to HMC for example, going beyond VI inference (which is simple to implement using existing deep learning tools), makes the software even more compelling.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"However, the most important factor of any PPL is whether it is practical for real-world use cases.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,This was not demonstrated sufficiently in the submission.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"There are many example code snippets given in the paper, but most are not evaluated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,The Dirichlet process mixture model example (Figure 12) is an important one: do the proposed black-box inference tools really work for this snippet?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,and will the GAN example (Figure 7) converge when optimised with real data?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,To convince the community of the practicality of the package it will be necessary to demonstrate these empirically.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"Currently the only evaluated model is a VAE with various inference techniques, which are not difficult to implement using pure TF.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Presentation:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,* Paper presentation could be improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,For example the authors could use more signalling for what is about to be explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,On page 5 qbeta and qz are used without explanation - the authors could mention that an example will be given thereafter.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"* I would also suggest to the authors to explain in the preface how the layers are implemented, and how the KL is handled in VI for example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,It will be useful to discuss what values are optimised and what values change as inference is performed (even before section 4.4).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,This was not clear for the majority of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Experiments:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"* What are the ""difficulties around convergence"" encountered with the analytical entropies?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,inference issues become more difficult to diagnose as inference is automated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Are there tools to diagnose these with the provided toolbox?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,* Did HMC give sensible results in the experiment at the bottom of page 8?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"* It would be extremely insightful to give a table comparing the performance (run time, predictive log likelihood, etc) of the various inference tools on more models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,What benchmarks do you intend to use in the Model Zoo?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,the difficulty with probabilistic modelling is that there are no set benchmarks over which we can evaluate and compare many models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Model zoo is sensible for the Caffe ecosystem because there exist few benchmarks a large portion of the community was working on (ImageNet for example).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,What datasets would you use to compare the DPMM on for example?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,* Table 1: I would suggest to compare to Li & Turner with alpha=0.5 (the equivalent of Hellinger distance) as they concluded this value performs best.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,I'm not sure why alpha=-1 was chosen here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,* How do you handle discrete distributions (eg Figure 5)?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"* Comma instead of period after ""rized), In"" on page 8.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"In conclusion I would say that the software developments presented here are quite exciting, and I'm glad the authors are pushing towards practical and accessible ""inference for all"".",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Other comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,In Sec. 2 you draw a clear distinction between specialised languages,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,This,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,seems unfair as I believe Stan is also Turing complete.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Additionally,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,no proof is provided to support the Turing-completeness of Edward.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,Thank you for an interesting read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,I found this paper very interesting.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,The only question I have is about the design of flexible objective functions to learn hyper-parameters (or in the paper those variables associated with delta q distributions).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy6b4Pqee,"It seems hyper-parameter learning is also specified as inference, which makes sense if using MAP.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,This paper will be of interest to anyone working with RNNs (which is a large,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,group of people!).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,Minor suggestion,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,As the authors mention - Zoneout has two things working for it - the noise and,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,the ability to pass gradients back without decay.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,"The continued analysis of this aspect, including analyzing how the gradient flow improves the given tasks, is of great interest and helps show it as an inherent property of zoneout.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,This is a well written paper with a variety of experiments that support the claims.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,I have also previously used this technique in a recurrent setting and am confident on the positive impact it can have upon tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqBEPcxe,This is likely to become a standard technique used within RNNs across various frameworks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,This is a very nice paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,The writing of the paper is clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,It starts from the traditional attention mechanism case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"By interpreting the attention variable z as a distribution conditioned on the input x and query q, the proposed method naturally treat them as latent variables in graphical models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,The potentials are computed using the neural network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"Under this view, the paper shows traditional dependencies between variables (i.e. structures) can be modeled explicitly into attentions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,This enables the use of classical graphical models such as CRF and semi-markov CRF in the attention mechanism to capture the dependencies naturally inherit in the linguistic structures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,The experiments of the paper prove the usefulness of the model in various level — seq2seq and tree structure etc.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,I think it’s solid and the experiments are carefully done.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,It also includes careful engineering such as normalizing the marginals in the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"In sum, I think this is a solid contribution and the approach will benefit the research in other problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,This is a solid paper that proposes to endow attention mechanisms with structure (the attention posterior probabilities becoming structured latent variables).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"Experiments are shown with segmental atention (as in semi-Markov models) and syntactic attention (as in projective dependency parsing), both in a synthetic task (tree transduction) and real world tasks (neural machine translation and natural language inference).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,There is a small gain in using structured attention over simple attention in the latter tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,A clear accept.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"The paper is very clear, the approach is novel and interesting, and the experiments seem to give a good proof of concept.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"However, the use of structured attention in neural MT seems doesn't seem to be fully exploited here: segmental attention could be a way of approaching neural phrase-based MT, and syntactic attention offers a way of incorporating latent syntax in MT",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,these seem very promising directions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"In particular it would be interesting to try to add some (semi-)supervision on these attention mechanisms (e.g. posterior marginals computed by an external parser) to see if that helps learning the attention components of the network, or at least help initializing them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,This seems to be the first interesting use of the backprop of forward-backward/inside-outside (Stoyanov et al. 2011).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkE0Nvqlg,"As stated in sec 3.3., for general probabilistic models the forward step over structured attention corresponds to the computation of first-order moments (posterior marginals) while the backprop step corresponds to second-order moments (gradients of marginals wrt log-potentials, i.e., Hessian of log-partition function).",0

In the Japanese-English Machine Translation example, the relative difference in performance between the Sigmoid attention model, and the Structured attention model appears to be relatively small. In this case, I’m curious if the authors analyzed the attention alignments to determine whether the structured models resulted in better alignments. In other words, if ground-truth alignments are available for the dataset, or if they can be human-annotated for some test examples, it would be interesting to measure the quality of the alignments in addition to the BLEU metric.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,The main interesting point is the empirical results of the experimental section.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,The approach is simple and performs better than previous non-learning based methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,This observation is interesting and will be of interest in structure discovery problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,I rate the specific construction of the supervised learning method as a reasonable attempt attempt to approach this problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,There is not very much technical novelty in this part.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"E.g., an algorithmic contribution would have been a method that is invariant to data permutation could have been a possible target for a technical contribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"The paper makes no claims on this technical part, as said, the method is well constructed and well executed.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"In summary, the paper makes a very interesting observation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,Graph estimation can be posed as a supervised learning problem and training data from a separate source is sufficient to learn structure in novel and unseen test data from a new source.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"Practically this may be relevant, on one hand the empirical results are stronger with this method, on the other hand a practitioner who is interested in structural discovery may have side constraints about interpretability of the deriving method.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"In general, I think it is an interesting and novel paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,The idea of framing structure estimation as a learning problem is especially interesting and may inspire further research on related topics.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,The advantage of such an approach is that it allows easier adaptation to different network structure properties without designing specific regularization terms as in graph lasso.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,The experiment results are also promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJOZBvcel,"In both synthetic and real-world datasets, the proposed algorithm outperforms other baselines in the small sample region.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByBwSPcex,I appreciate the review early on of music theory concepts.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByBwSPcex,I think the paper provides a reasonable support for the connection between how pop music is composed and the hierarchical model for generating melody accompanied with chords and drums.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByBwSPcex,A simpler design with rating one sample at a time may have been more appropriate because there is no natural way to pair the songs.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The convergence is demonstrated only for three dropout values in Figure 2 which may cause an unfair comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,For instance how does the convergence compare for the best dropout rate after cross-validation (three figures each figure has three results for one method with different dropouts [bests cv result for each one])?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Also how is the corresponding validation error and test iterations?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Also only mnist does not have to generalize to other benchmarks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"Figure 3 gives closer results for Adam optimizer, learning rate is not selected with random search or bayesian optimization, learning decay iterations fixed and regularization coefficient is set to a small value without tuning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,A slightly better tuning of parameters may close the current gap.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Also Nesterov based competitor gives unreasonably worse accuracy compared to recent results which may indicate that this experiment should not be taken into account.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"In Table 2, there is no significant improvement on CIFAR10.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The CIFAR100 difference is not significant without including batch normalization variance re-estimation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,However there is no result for 'original with BN update' therefore it is not clear whether the BN update helps in general or not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,SVHN also does not have result for original with BN update.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"There should be baselines with batch normalizations for Figure 1,2 3 to support the claims convincingly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"The main criticism about batch normalization is additional computational cost by giving (Mishkin et al, 2016 )",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,as reference however this should not be a reason to not to compare the initialization to batch-normalization.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"In fact, (Mishkin et al, 2016) performs comparison to batch normalization and also with and without data augmentation with recent state of art architectures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,None of the empirical results have data augmentation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,It is not clear if the initialization or  batch normalization update will help or make it worse for that case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Recent state of art methods methods like Res Net variant and Dense Net scale to many depths and report result for ImageNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"Although the authors claim that this can be extended to residual network variants, it is not clear if there is going to be any empirical gain for that architectures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,This work requires a comprehensive and fair comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Otherwise the contribution is not significant.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The main observation made in the paper is that the use of dropout increases the variance of neurons.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"Correcting for this increase in variance, in the parameter initialization, and in the test-time statistics of batch normalization, improves performance, as is shown reasonably convincingly in the experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"This observation is important, as it applies to many of the models used in the literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,It's not extremely novel (it's been observed in the literature before that our simple dropout approximations at test time do not achieve the accuracy obtained by full Monte Carlo dropout),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The paper could use more experimental validation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Specifically:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"I'm guessing the correction for dropout variance at test time is not only specific to batch normalization: Standard dropout, in networks without batch normalization, corrects only for the mean at test time (by dividing activations by one minus the dropout probability).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,This work suggests it would be beneficial to also correct for the variance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Has this been tested?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,How does the dropout variance correction compare to using Monte Carlo dropout at test time?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,(i.e. just averaging over a large number of random dropout masks),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The paper presents an approach for compensating the input/activation variance introduced by dropout in a network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,"Additionally, a practical inference trick of re-estimating the batch normalization parameters with dropout turned off before testing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The authors very well show how dropout influences the input/activation variance and then scale the initial weights accordingly to achieve unit variance which helps in avoiding activation outputs exploding or vanishing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,It is shown that the presented approach serves as a good initialization technique for deep networks and results in performances op par or slightly better than the existing approaches.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The limited experimental validation and only small difference in accuracies compared to existing methods makes it difficult to judge the effectiveness of presented approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Perhaps observing the statistics of output activations and gradients over training epochs in multiple experiments can better support the argument of stability of the network using proposed approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,Authors might consider adding some validation for considering the backpropagation variance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,On multiple occasions comparison is drawn against batch normalization which I believe does much more than a weight initialization technique.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1BJLw9ex,The presented approach is a good initialization technique just not sure if its better than existing ones.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,The paper shows how group convolutions (for two dimensional commutative groups) can be performed by standard CNNs if the input is warped using a fixed warp.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,The idea is practical and seems to work well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,The paper is well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,I agree with reviewer 1 that the ‘theorems’ do not deserve to be labelled as such.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Theorem 1 is equivalent to the second equation from this section of the wikipedia page on convolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Convolutions_on_groups.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The existence of Haar measure (from which commutation of Lg and convolution follows immediately) is a well known and elementary theorem in harmonic analysis, which would be treated in the first few pages of any textbook on the subject.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,It also immediately clear that any commutative group has an additive parameterization (theorem 2).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The fact that the paper does not present new deep mathematical results is not a significant weakness in my opinion, but the derivations should not be camouflaged as such.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The claim that previous methods that use group convolutions are slow and that the presented approach has better computational complexity is not supported by empirical evidence, and the theoretical analysis is still a bit misleading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"For example, the authors write “Unfortunately these approaches do not possess the same memory and speed benefits that CNNs enjoy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The reason is that, ultimately, they have to enumerate all possible transformations”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The presented method also has to enumerate all transformations (in a limited range, on a discretized grid), and this is feasible only because the group is only 2 dimensional (and indeed this is also true for standard CNNs which enumerate translations).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"As noted in my pre-review question, I believe the computational complexity analysis is not entirely correct, and assume the authors will correct this.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"Equation 4 is presented as a new invention, but this has been used in previous works and is well known in mathematics, so a citation should be added.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The main advantage of the presented method over several earlier methods is that it is very simple to implement, and can re-use highly optimized convolution routines.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"As I understand it, Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling also use standard convolutions (after a fixed filter / feature map warp), but these papers only consider discrete groups.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,So it seems like this paper occupies a unique place in the space of equivariant convolutional networks:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"non-commutative (-), low-dimensional (-), continuous (+) groups, simple (+) and efficient (+) algorithm.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"Given the proximity though, a more thorough and balanced appraisal of the merits and demerits, as well as the novelty, relative to each of the previous works would be useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"Provided that these issues are cleared up, I would recommend the paper for publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,The paper suggests method to make the convolution invariant to other type of spatial transformations besides translation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"It is interesting that the convolution can be invariant to different variation types by simple warping of the input image, which is related to arbitrary data perturbation in image recognition.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Experiment section needs more description and technique implementation details.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,The relationship of theorems to Lie group is not defined properly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,It need more detailed comparison of method with available methods in the literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,This paper deals with convolution along Lie groups.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Good numerical results,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Interesting applications linked to convolutions on Lie groups,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"Sometimes, the writing is not clear/poor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"The theorems 1 and 2 are in fact direct applications of Lie group theory, but this is not made explicit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"I do not detail more my review, as I believe my questions/answers complete it fairly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,"However, if the authors require it, I can be more specific.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkmM8Dceg,I think the writing should be improved a bit.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"This paper proposes the Layerwise Origin Target Synthesis (LOTS) method, which entails computing a difference in representation at a given layer in a neural network and then projecting that difference back to input space using backprop.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"Two types of differences are explored: linear scalings of a single input’s representation and difference vectors between representations of two inputs, where the inputs are of different classes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"In the former case, the LOTS method is used as a visualization of the representation of a specific input example, showing what it would mean, in input space, for the feature representation to be supressed or magnified.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"While it’s an interesting computation to perform, the value of the visualizations is not very clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"In the latter case, LOTS is used to generate adversarial examples, moving from an origin image just far enough toward a target image to cause the classification to flip.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"As expected, the changes required are smaller when LOTS targets a higher layer (in the limit of targetting the last layer, results similar to the original adversarial image results would be obtained).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,The paper is an interesting basic exploration and would probably be a great workshop paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"However, the results are probably not quite compelling enough to warrant a full ICLR paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,A few suggestions for improvement:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"- Several times it is claimed that LOTS can be used as a method for mining for diverse adversarial examples that could be used in training classifiers more robust to adversarial perturbation. But this simple experiment of training on LOTS generated examples isn’t tried. Showing whether the LOTS method outperforms, say, FGS would go a long way toward making a strong paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"- How many layers are in the networks used in the paper, and what is their internal structure? This isn’t stated anywhere. I was left wondering whether, say, in Fig 2 the CONV2_1 layer was immediately after the CONV1_1 layer and whether the FC8 layer was the last layer in the network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"- In Fig 1, 2, 3, and 4, results of the application of LOTS are shown for many intermediate layers but miss for some reason applying it to the input (data) layer and the output/classification (softmax) layer. Showing the full range of possible results would reinforce the interpreatation (for example, in Fig 3, are even larger perturbations necessary in pixel space vs CONV1 space? And does operating directly in softmax space result in smaller perturbations than IP2?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,- The PASS score is mentioned a couple times but never explained at all. E.g. Fig 1 makes use of it but does not specify such basics as whether higher or lower PASS scores are associated with more or less severe perturbations. A basic explanation would be great.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"- 4.2 states “In summary, the visualized internal feature representations of the origin suggest that lower convolutional layers of the VGG Face model have managed to learn and capture features that provide semantically meaningful and interpretable representations to human observers.” I don’t see that this follows from any results. If this is an important claim to the paper, it should be backed up by additional arguments or results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,1/19/17 UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"Given that experiments were added to the latest version of the paper, I'm increasing my review from 5 -> 6.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,I think the paper is now just on the accept side of the threshold.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,The paper presents a new exciting layerwise origin-target synthesis method both for generating a large number of diverse adversarials as well as for understanding the robustness of various layers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,The methodology is then used to visualize the amount of perturbation necessary for producing a change for higher level features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,The approach to match the features of another unrelated image is interesting and it goes beyond producing adversarials for classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,It can also generate adversarials for face-recognition and other models where the result is matched with some instance from a database.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"Pro: The presented approach is definitely sound, interesting and original.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,Con: The analyses presented in this paper are relatively shallow and don't touch the most obvious questions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,There is not much experimental quantitative evidence for the efficacy of this method compared with other approaches to produce adversarials.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,The visualization is not very exciting and it is hard to any draw any meaningful conclusions from them.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,It would definitely improve the paper if it would present some interesting conclusions based on the new ideas.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,This paper presents a relatively novel way to visualize the features / hidden units of a neural network and generate adversarial examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"The idea is to do gradient descent in the pixel space, from a given hidden unit in any layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,This can either be done by choosing a pair of images and using the difference in activations of the unit as the thing to do gradient descent over or just the activation itself of the unit for a given image.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"In general this method seems intriguing, here are some comments:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"It’s not clear that some of the statements at the beginning of Sec 4.1 are actually true, re: positive/negative signs and how that changes (or does not change) the class.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"Mathematically, I don’t see why that would be the case?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,Moreover the contradictory evidence from MNIST vs. faces supports my intuition.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"The authors use the PASS score through the paper, but only given an intuition + citation for it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"I think it’s worth explaining what it actually does, in a sentence or two.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"The PASS score seems to have some, but not complete, correlation with L_2, L_\{infty} or visual estimation of how “good” the adversarial examples are.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,I am not sure what the take-home message from all these numbers is.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"“In general, LOTS cannot produce high quality adversarial examples at the lower layers” (sec 5.2) seems false for MNIST, no?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"I would have liked this work to include more quantitative results (e.g., extract adversarial examples at different layers, add them to the training set, train networks, compare on test set), in addition to the visualizations present.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"That to me is the main drawback of the paper, in addition to basically no comparisons with other methods (it’s hard to judge the merits of this work in vacuum).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,EDIT after rebuttal:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,thanks to the authors for addressing the experimental validation concerns.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkCILwqex,"I think this makes the paper more interesting, so revising my score accordingly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ6yPD5xg,This paper proposes a way of adding unsupervised auxiliary tasks to a deep RL agent like A3C. Authors propose a bunch of auxiliary control tasks and auxiliary reward tasks and evaluate the agent in Labyrinth and Atari.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ6yPD5xg,Proposed UNREAL agent performs significantly better than A3C and also learns faster.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ6yPD5xg,This is definitely a good contribution to the conference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ6yPD5xg,"However, this is not a surprising result since adding additional auxiliary tasks that are relevant to the goal should always help in better and faster feature shaping.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,This paper proposed a new joint training scheme for two probabilistic models of signals (e.g. images) which are both deep neural network based and are termed generator and descriptor networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,"In the new scheme, termed cooperative training, the two networks train together and assist each other: the generator network provides samples that work as initial samples for the descriptor network, and the descriptor network updates those samples to help guide training of the generator network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,This is an interesting approach for coupling the training of these two models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,The paper however is quite weak on the empirical studies.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,"The training datasets are tiny, from sets of 1 image to 5-6.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,What is the reason for not using larger sets?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,I think the small datasets are leading to over training and are really masking the true value of the proposed cooperative training approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1E7Pwqgl,For most of the experiments presented in the paper it is hard to assess the specific value brought by the proposed cooperative training approach because baseline results are missing.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,[Major comments],1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,My main concern is that that evaluation results are NOT strong.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"Either knowledge base completion or KB-based question answering, there are many existing and competitive benchmarks (e.g., FB15k / WebQuestions).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,Experimenting with such a tiny WordCup2014 dataset is not convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"Moreover, the questions are just generated by a few templates, which is far from NL questions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,I am not even not sure why we need to apply an LSTM in such scenario.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,The paper would be much stronger if you can demonstrate its effectiveness on the above benchmarks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,Conjunctive queries:  the current model assumes that all the detected entities in the question could be aligned to one or more relations and we can take conjunctions in the end.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"This assumption might be not always correct, so it is more necessary to justify this on real QA datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"The model is named as  “Gaussian attention” and I kind of think it is not very closely related to well-known attention mechanism, but more related to KB embedding literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,[Minor comments],1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,I find Figure 2 a bit confusing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"The first row of orange blocks denote KB relations, and the second row of those denote every single word of the NL question.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,This is supposed to allow more control on the attention by dealing with its spread.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,This is a dense paper centered around a quite complicated model.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,I like the idea of controlling the spread of the attention.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,This makes sense.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"However, I do not feel that this paper is convincing enough to justify its use compared to usual inner products.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,For several reasons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,These should be more ablation experiments to separate the different pieces of the model and study their influence separately.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,The only interesting point in that sense is Table 8 in Appendix B.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,We need more of this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"In particular, a canonical experiments comparing Gaussian interaction vs inner product would be very useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"Experiments on existing benchmarks (for KB completion, or QA) would help.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"I agree with the authors that it is difficult to find the perfect benchmark, so it is a good idea to propose a new one (WorldCup2014).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,But this should come in addition to experiments on existing data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,Table 11 of Appendix C (page 16) that compares TransE and TransGaussian for the task of link prediction on WordNet can be seen as fixing the two points above (simple setting on existing benchmark).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByC7ww9le,"Unfortunately, TransGaussian does not perform well compared to simpler TransE. This, along with the poor results of TransGaussian (SINGLE) of Table 2, indicate that training TransGaussian seems pretty complex, and hence question the actual validity of this architecture.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"The main shortcoming is that the implementation of Toderici et al. 2016b appears to be incomplete, and there is no comparison to Balle et al. 2016.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,I have no further specific comments at this time as they were answered sufficiently in the pre-review questions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,The paper proposes a neural approach to learning an image compression-decompression scheme as an auto-encoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"While the idea is certainly interesting and well-motivated, in practice, it turns out to achieve effectively identical rates to JPEG-2000.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"Now, as the authors argue, there is some value to the fact that this scheme was learned automatically rather than by expert design",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"which means it has benefits beyond the compression of natural images (e.g., it could be used to automatically learning a compression scheme for signals for which we don't have as much domain knowledge).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"However, I still believe that this makes the paper unsuitable for publication in its current form because of the following reasons",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"1. Firstly, the fact that the learned encoder is competitive",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,and not clearly better,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"than JPEG 2000 means that the focus of the paper should more be about the aspects in which the encoder is similar to, and the aspects in which it differs, from JPEG 2000.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,Is it learning similar filters or completely different ones ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,For what kinds of textures does it do better and for what kinds does it do worse (the paper could show the best and worst 10 patches at different bit-rates) ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"2. Secondly, I think it's crucial that the paper demonstrate that the benefits come from a better coding scheme (as opposed to just a better decoder), as suggested in my initial pre-review question. How would a decoder trained on JPEG-2000 codes (and perhaps also on encoded random projections) do worse or better ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJiNwv9gg,"3. Finally, I think the fact that it does as well/worse than JPEG-2000 significantly diminishes the case for using a 'deep' auto-encoder. JPEG-2000 essentially uses a wavelet transform, which is a basis that past studies have shown could be recovered using a simple sparse dictionary algorithm like K-SVD. This is why I feel that the method needs to clearly outperform JPEG-2000, or show comparisons to (or atleast discuss) a well-crafted traditional/generative model-based baseline.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,The paper proposes a method for pruning weights in neural networks during training to obtain sparse solutions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,The approach is applied to an RNN-based system which is trained and evaluated on a speech recognition dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,The results indicate that large savings in test-time computations can be obtained without affecting the task performance too much.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,In some cases the method can actually improve the evaluation performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,The experiments are done using a state-of-the-art RNN system and the methodology of those experiments seems sound.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,I like that the effect of the pruning is investigated for networks of very large sizes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,The computational gains are clearly substantial.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,"[2], where a threshold is used to prune weights after training, followed by a retraining phase of the remaining weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,"While I think that it is certainly more elegant to replace this three stage procedure with a single training phase, the proposed scheme still contains multiple regimes that resemble such a process by first training without pruning followed by pruning at two different rates and finally training without further pruning again.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylSPv9gx,Summary: The paper presents a technique to convert a dense to sparse network for RNNs. The algorithm will increasingly set more weights to zero during the RNN training phase. This provides a RNN model with less storage requirement and higher inference rate.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,It might be interesting to see how this falls into your framework.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Experimental results were presented clearly and well illustrated the usefulness of the metacontroller.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,I'm curious to see the results of using more metaexperts.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"This paper presents a novel metacontroller optimization system that learns the best action for a one-shot learning task, but as a framework has the potential for wider application.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,The metacontroller is a model-free reinforcement learning agent that selects how many optimization iterations and what function or “expert” to consult from a fixed set (such as an action-value or state transition function).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"Experimental results are presented from simulation experiments where a spacecraft must fire its thruster once to reach a target location, in the presence of between 1 and 5 heavy bodies.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"However, by taking into account the computational complexity of running a classical, iterative optimization procedure as a second “resource loss” term, the metacontroller is shown to be more efficient.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"Moreover, the metacontroller agent successfully selects the optimal expert to consult, rather than relying on an informed choice by a domain-expert model designer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"The experimental performance is a contribution that merits publication, and it also exhibits the use of an interaction network for learning the dynamics of a simulated physical system.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,The dataset constitutes an ancillary contribution which could positively impact future research in this area.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Cons:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Perhaps thinner bars of different colors would help here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"Moreover, this figure lacks a legend and so the different lines are impossible to compare with each other.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,This makes understanding this figure difficult.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"3) in Figure 4, the shaded area represents a 95% confidence interval on the regression line; in addition, it would be helpful to give a standard error on the regression slope (to verify that it excludes zero, i.e. the slope is significant), as well as a fraction of explained variance (R^2).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"4) in Figure 5, the fraction of samples using the MLP expert does not appear to decrease monotonically with the increasing cost of the MLP expert (i.e. the bottom left part of the right plot, with a few red-shaded boxes).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Why is that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Is there lots of variance in these fractions from experiment to experiment?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Thank you for all these details.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Thank you for an interesting read on an approach to choose computational models based on kind of examples given.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"As an idea, using a meta controller to decide the computational model and the number of steps to reach the conclusion is keeping in line with solving an important practical issue of increased computational times of a simple example.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,The approach seems similar to an ensemble learning construct.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,But instead of random experts and a fixed computational complexity during testing time the architecture is designed to estimate hyper-parameters like number of ponder steps which gives this approach a distinct advantage.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,Cons,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk8BvDqex,"Even though the metacontroller is designed to choose the best amongst the given experts, its complete capability has not been explored yet.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Model is clearly described in detail.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"In my thoughts, a clear accept.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Summary: The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture for the task of question answering on the SQuAD dataset. The model consists of two main components,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,coattention encoder and dynamic pointer decoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,The encoder produces attention over the question as well as over the document in parallel and thus learns co-dependent representations of the question and the document.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"The decoder predicts the starting and the end token of the answer iteratively, with the motivation that multiple iterations will help the model escape local maxima and thus will reduce the errors made by the model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,The proposed model achieved state-of-art result on SQuAD dataset at the time of writing the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"The paper reports some analyses of the results such as performance across question types, document, question, answer lengths, etc.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"The paper also performs some ablation studies such as performing only single round of iteration on decoder, etc.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,1. The paper is well-motivated with two main motivations,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"co-attending to the document and the question, and iteratively producing the answer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,2. The proposed model architecture is novel and the design choices made seem reasonable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,3. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the existing model (at the time of writing the paper) on the SQuAD dataset by significant margin.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,4. The analyses of the results and the ablation studies performed (as per someone's request) provide insights into the various modelling design choices made.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Weaknesses/Questions/Suggestions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"1. In order to gain insights into how much each additional iteration in the decoder help, I would like to see the following",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,for every iteration report the mean F1 for questions that converged in that iteration along with the number of questions that converged in that iteration.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,2. Example of Question 3 in figure 5 is an interesting example where the model is unable to decide between multiple local maxima despite several iterations. Could authors please report how often this happens?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"3. In order to estimate how much modelling of attention in the encoder helps, it would be good if authors could report the performance of the model when attention is not modeled at all in the encoder (neither over question, nor over document).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,4. I would like to see the variation in the performance of the proposed model for questions that require different types of reasoning (table 3 in SQuAD paper). This would provide insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model w.r.t the type reasoning required.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"5. In Wang and Jiang (2016), the attention is predicted over question for each word in the document. But in table 2, when performing ablation study to make the proposed model similar to Wang and Jiang, C^D is set to C^Q. But isn’t C^Q attention over document for each word in the question? So, how is this similar to Wang and Jiang’s attention? I think QA^D will be similar to Wang and Jiang's attention since QA^D is attention over question for each word in the document. Please clarify.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"6. In section 2.1, “n” and “m” are swapped when explaining the Document and Question encoding matrix. Please fix it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Review Summary: The paper presents a novel and interesting model for the task of question answering on SQuAD dataset and shows that the model outperforms existing models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"However, to gain more insights into the functioning of the model, I would like see more analyses of the results and one more ablation study (see weaknesses section above).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,This paper proposed a dynamic coattention network for the question answering task with long contextual documents.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"The model is able to encode co-dependent representations of the question and the document, and a dynamic decoder iteratively pointing the potential answer spans to locate the final answer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"Overall, this is a well-written paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,"Although the model is a bit complicated (coattention encoder, iterative dynamic pointering decoder and highway maxout network), the intuitions behind and the details of the model are clearly presented.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,Also the performance on the SQuAD dataset is good.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeKjwvclx,I would recommend this paper to be accepted.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The paper proposes a method of integrating recurrent layers within larger, potentially pre-trained, convolutional networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The objective is to combine the feature extraction abilities of CNNs with the ability of RNNs to gather global context information.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The authors validate their idea on two tasks, image classification (on CIFAR-10) and semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC12).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"On the positive side, the paper is clear and well-written (apart from some occasional typos), the proposed idea is simple and could be adopted by other works, and can be deployed as a beneficial perturbation of existing systems, which is practically important if one wants to increase the performance of a system without retraining it from scratch.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The evaluation is also systematic, providing a clear ablation study.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"On the negative side, the novelty of the work is relatively limited, while the validation is lacking a bit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Regarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"This contribution ("" we use RNNs within layers"") is repeatedly mentioned in the paper (including intro &  conclusion), but in my understanding was part of Bell et al, modulo minor changes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Regarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Furthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"report  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,So.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The authors answer: ""Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.""",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"So, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being ""yes, if you want to keep your network shallow"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Probably an evaluation on imagenet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Regarding semantic segmentation, one of my questions has been:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"""Is the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"(I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The answer was:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"""...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences""",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"I could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Clearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Furthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"In practice the ""FCN8s"" prefix of ""FCN8s-LRNN"" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Another thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that ""when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. """,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"This is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,A few additional points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,It seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Figure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?),0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The paper is very clear and easy to read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Enough details are given that the paper can likely be reproduced with or without source code.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Using 1D RNNs inside CNNs is a topic that deserves more experimental exploration than what exists in the literature.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"(1) Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,(2) Disappointed in the actual use of the proposed L-RNN module versus how it's sold in the intro.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"(1,2): The introduction states w.r.t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Bell et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"""more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,L-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"matrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"I felt positive about these contributions after reading the intro, but then much less so after reading the experimental sections.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Based on the first contribution (""general block that can be inserted into any layer""), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,While not exactly the same as Bell et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"(there are many technical details that differ), it is close.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Is there any advantage to the proposed design?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Or is it a variation that performs similarly?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"The second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other ask (e.g., detection).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Minor suggestion:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,Figure 4 is hard to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The pixelated rounded corners on the yellow boxes are distracting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The authors propose the use of a vertical and horizontal one-dimensional RNN (denoted as L-RNN module) to capture long-range dependencies and summarize convolutional feature maps.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"L-RNN modules are an alternative to deeper or wider networks, 2D RNNs, dilated (Atrous) convolutional layers, and a simple flatten or global pooling layer when applied to the last convolutional layer for classification.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"L-RNN modules are faster than 2D RNNs, since rows and columns can be processed in parallel, are easy to implemented, and can be inserted in existing convolutional networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,The authors demonstrate improvements for classification and semantic segmentation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"However, further evaluations are required that show for which use cases L-RNNs are superior to alternatives for summarizing convolutional feature maps:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"1. I suggest to use a fixed CNN with as certain number of layers, and summarize the last feature map by a) a flatten layer, b) global average pooling, c) a 2D RNN, d) and dilated convolutional layers for segmentation. The authors should report both the run-time and number of parameters for these variants in addition to prediction performances. For segmentation, the number of dilated convolutional layers should be chosen such that the number of parameters is similar to a single L-RNN module.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"2. The authors compare classification performances only on 32x32 CIFAR-10 images. For higher resolution images, the benefit of L-RNN modules to capture long-range dependencies might be more pronounced. I therefore suggest evaluating classification performances on one additional dataset with higher resolution images, e.g. ImageNet or the CUB bird dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"Additionally, I have the following minor comments:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,3. The authors use vanilla RNNs. It might be worth investigating LSTMs or GRUs instead.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"4. For classification, the authors summarize hidden states of the final vertical recurrent layer by global max pooling. Is this different from more common global average pooling or concatenating the final forward and backward recurrent states?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"5. Table 3 is hard to understand since it mingles datasets (Pascal P and COCO C) and methods (CRF post-processing). I suggest, e.g., using an additional column with CRF ‘yes’ or ‘no’. I further suggest listing the number of parameters and runtime if possible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,6. Section 3 does not clearly describe in which order batch-normalization is applied in residual blocks. Figure 2 suggest that the newer BN-ReLU-Conv order described in He et al. (2016) is used. This should be mentioned in the text.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJRDvcex,"7. Equation (1) is the update of a vanilla RNN, which should be stated more clearly.

The model reads each sentence in the input document twice and creates a hierarchical representation of it instead of a bidirectional RNN. During the decoding, it uses the representation of the document obtained via the read-again mechanism and points the words that are OOV in the source document. The model does abstractive summarization. The authors show improvements on DUC 2004 dataset and provide an analysis of their model with different configurations.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJPmdP9le,1. This paper introduces 2-pass reading where the representations from the 1st-pass is used to  re-wight the contribution of each word to the sequential representation of the 2nd-pass. The authors described how such a so-called read-again process applies to both GRU and LSTM.,1

On the decoder side, the authors also use the softmax to choose between generating from decoder vocabulary and copying a source position, with a new twist of representing the previous decoded word Y_{t-1} differently. This allows the author to explore a smaller decoder vocabulary hence led to faster inference time without losing summarization performance.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,"2) It reports that for 3 different 2-AFC tasks for which there exists a condition that is hard and one that is easy for humans, the mutual information between decision label and quantised CNN activations is usually higher in the condition that is easier for humans.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,To make a convincing statement it would be important to explore what aspects of the CNN lead to the reported findings.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,One possible way of doing that could be to include good baseline models to compare against.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,"As I mentioned before, one such baseline should be reasonable low-level vision model.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,"The results of the baseline models often raise more questions and make the interpretation of the results more complex, but I feel that this reflects the complexity of the topic and makes the work rather more worthwhile.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJbD_Pqlg,"One further suggestion: As the experiments with the snapshots of the CaffeNet shows, the direct relationship between CNN performance and prediction accuracy of biological vision known from Yamins et al. 2014 and Cadieu et al. 2014 does not necessarily hold in your experiments.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,that matches correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations between feature responses at the same position in the feature maps.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,b) improves performance on texture inpainting tasks compared to the Gatys et al. method,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,c) improves results in season transfer when combined with the style transfer method by Gatys et al.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,Furthermore the paper shows that,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,"d) by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps, symmetry properties around the flipping axis can be preserved.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,I agree with claim a).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGTuv9eg,"However, the generated textures still have some issues such as greyish regions so the problem is not solved.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryEGFD9gl,"1. I think the clarity of the paper would benefit significantly from fixes to inaccuracies. E.g., \alpha-expansion and belief propagation are not `scene-understanding algorithms’ but rather approaches for optimizing energy functions. Computing the MAP state of an SSPN in time sub-linear in the network size seems counterintuitive because it means we are not allowed to visit all the nodes in the network. The term `deep probabilistic model’ should probably be defined. The paper states that InferSSPN computes `the approximate MAP state of the SSPN (equivalently, the optimal parse of the image)’ and I’m wondering how the `approximate MAP state' can be optimal. Etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryEGFD9gl,"2. Albeit being formulated for scene understanding tasks, no experiments demonstrate the obtained results of the proposed technique. To assess the applicability of the proposed approach a more detailed analysis is required.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,The paper proposes a novel architecture which jointly attends over the context and the query.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,1. The paper is clearly written and illustrated.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,2. The architecture is new and incorporates novel and interesting aspects:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,2.1. The attention is not summarized immediately but the features are only weighted with the attention to not loose information.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,"3.1. It is worth noting that the paper even compares mainly favorably to concurrent work (including other ICLR 2017 submissions), recently published/listed on the evaluation server for SQuAD",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,4. The paper also includes an ablation study and qualitative results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,5. I think the paper provides a good discussion of related work and I like that it points out the relations to Visual question answering (VQA). It would be interesting to see how the architecture can be adapted and works on the VQA task.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ0UKP9ge,Given the new architecture with novel aspects and the strong experimental evaluation I recommend to accept the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,This paper proposes a multimodal neural machine translation that is based upon previous work using variational methods but attempts to ground semantics with images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,Considering way to improve translation with visual information seems like a sensible thing to do when such data is available.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,This makes the gains reported by the authors very marginal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,"In addition, as the author's also said in their question response, it is not clear if the model is really learning to capture useful image semantics.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,"The paper proposes an approach to the task of multimodal machine translation, namely to the case when an image is available that corresponds to both source and target sentences.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,The idea seems to be to use a latent variable model and condition it on the image.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,In practice from Equation 3 and Figure 3 one can see that the image is only used during training to do inference.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,The qualitative analysis in Subsection 4.4 appears inconclusive and unconvincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,"Overall, there are major issues with both the approach and the execution of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,I have problems understanding the motivation of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,"The authors claimed to have captured a latent representation of text and image during training and can translate better without images at test time, but didn't demonstrate convincingly that images help (not to mention the setup is a bit strange when there are no images at test time).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,The qualitative analysis doesn't convince me that the models have learned latent representations; I am guessing the gains are due to less overfitting because of the participation of images during training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,The dataset is too small to experiment with NMT.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,"I'm not sure if it's fair to compare their models with NMT and VNMT given the following description in Section 4.1 ""VNMT is fine-tuned by NMT and our models are fine-tuned with VNMT"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,(c) I'm not sure if it's correct in Section 3.2.2 h'_z is computed from \mu and \sigma.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,So how \mu' and \sigma' are being used ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,(d) G+O-AVG should be something like G+O_{AVG}.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,The minus sign makes it looks like there's an ablation test there.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1G9tvcgx,Other things: no explanations for Figure 2 & 3.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg,The main theoretical conclusion seems to be the preimage being this stitch of lower dimensional subspaces?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg,"It feels like the right direction, but it didn't got to a point where we can use it to identify the underlying mechanism behind our models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg,"We know relu models need to split apart and unite different region of the space, and I think we can agree that we can construct such mechanism (it comes from the fact that relu models are universal approximators) ..",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg,though this doesn't speak to what happens in practice.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJcLcw9xg,All in all I think this work needs a bit more work yet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"This paper presents and evaluates a Scala-based deep learning framework called “DeepDSL,” describing the language’s syntactic and performance benefits with respect to existing frameworks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"The use of Scala is unique among deep learning frameworks, to my knowledge, making this framework interesting for Scala users.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,The fact that Scala compiles to Java and therefore cross-platform support comes for free is also nice.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,The ability to inspect memory information as shown in Figure 3 is interesting and potentially useful for large networks or situations where memory is limited.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,DeepDSL compares favorably with existing frameworks in terms of memory use and speed for many common convolutional network architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"There appears to be special privileged handling of parameters, gradients, and updates in the compilation process itself (as in Caffe), rather than having gradients/updates as a normal part of the full user-defined computation graph (as in Theano + TensorFlow).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"This makes certain applications, such as RNNs (which require parameter sharing) and GANs (which require gradients wrt multiple objectives), impossible to implement in DeepDSL without further extension of the underlying API.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,(Note: I might be wrong about this,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,and please correct me if I am,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"but all the examples in the paper are nets trained by gradient descent on a single objective, and do not share parameters or access gradients directly.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,The paper repeatedly refers to line counts from the verbose Protobuf-based low-level representation of networks in Caffe to demonstrate the compactness of its own syntax.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,This is misleading as Caffe has officially supported a compact network definition style called “NetSpec” for years,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,see a ~15 line definition of AlexNet,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,[1].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"Given that, Protobuf is essentially an intermediate representation for Caffe (as with TensorFlow), which happens to have a human-readable text format.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"DeepDSL is not especially novel when compared with existing frameworks, which is not a problem in and of itself, but some statements misleadingly or incorrectly oversell the novelty of the framework.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,Some examples:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,“This separation between network definition and training is an unique advantage of DeepDSL comparing to other tools.”,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,This separation is not unique,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"it’s certainly a feature of Caffe where the network definition is its own file, and can be attained in TensorFlow as well (though it’s not the default workflow there).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"“The difference [between our framework and Theano, TensorFlow, etc.] is that we do not model deep networks as ‘networks’ but as abstract ‘functions’.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,There is no notion of a “network” in Theano or TensorFlow (not sure about the others) either,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"there are only functions, like in DeepDSL.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"I asked about this statement, and the response didn’t convince me otherwise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,The counterexample given was that in TensorFlow the number of input channels needs to be specified separately for each convolution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,This is only true using the low-level API and can easily be worked around with higher-level wrappers like TensorFlow Slim,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"e.g., see the definition of AlexNet",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,[2].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"It may be true that DeepDSL is more “batteries included” for writing compact network definitions than these other frameworks, but the paper’s claims seem to go beyond this.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bks8cPcxe,"Overall, the DeepDSL framework seems to have real value in its use of Scala and its memory/speed efficiency as demonstrated by the experiments, but the current version of the paper contains statements that overclaim novelty in ways that are misleading and unfair to existing frameworks.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,Description:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"This paper presents a reinforcement learning architecture where, based on ""natural-language"" input, a meta-controller chooses subtasks and communicates them to a subtask controller that choose primitive actions, based on the communicated subtask.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The goal is to scale up reinforcement learning agents to large-scale tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"The subtask controller embeds the subtask definition (arguments) into vectors by a multi-layer perceptron including an ""analogy-making"" regularization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The subtask vectors are combined with inputs at each layer of a CNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,CNN outputs (given the observation and the subtask) are then fed to one of two MLPs; one to compute action probabilities in the policy (exponential falloff of MLP outputs) and the other to compute termination probability (sigmoid from MLP outputs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The meta controller takes a list of sentences as instructions embeds them into a sequence of subtask arguments (not necessarily a one-to-one mapping).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"A context vector is computed by a CNN from the observation, the previous sentence embedding, the previous subtask and its completion state.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"The subtask arguments are computed from the context vector through further mechanisms involving instruction retrieval from memory pointers, and hard/soft decisions whether to update the subtask or not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"Training involves policy distillation+actor-critic training for the subtask controller, and actor-critic training for the meta controller keeping the subtask controller frozen.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The system is tested in a grid world where the agent moves and interacts with (picks up/transforms) various item/enemy types.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"It is compared to a) a flat controller not using a subtask controller, and b) subtask control by mere concatenation of the subtask embedding to the input with/without the analogy-making regularization.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"The proposed architecture seems reasonable, although it is not clear why the specific way of combining subtask embeddings in the subtask controller would be the ""right"" way to do it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"I do not feel the grid world here really represents a ""large-scale task"": in particular the 10x10 size of the grid is very small.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,This is disappointing since this was a main motivation of the work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"Moreover, the method is not compared to any state of the art alternatives.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,This is especially problematic because the test is not on established benchmarks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"It is not really possible, based on the shown results, to put the performance in context of other works.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,This paper presents an architecture and corresponding algorithms for,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"learning to act across multiple tasks, described in natural language.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The proposed system is hierarchical and is closely related to the options,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"However, rather than learning a discrete set of options, it learns",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,a mapping from natural instructions to an embedding which implicitly (dynamically),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,defines an option.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,This is a novel and interesting new perspective on options,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,which had only slightly been explored in the linear setting (see comments below).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,I find the use of policy distillation particularly relevant for this setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"This, on its own, could be a takeaway for many RL readers who might not necessarily",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,be interested about NLP applications.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"In general, the paper does not describe a single, simple, end-to-end,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,recipe for learning with this architecture.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,It rather relies on many recent,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"advances skillfully combined: generalized advantage estimation, analogy-making",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"regularizers, L1 regularization, memory addressing, matrix factorization,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,policy distillation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,I would have liked to see some analysis but,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,understand that it would have certainly been no easy task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"For example, when you say ""while the parameters of the subtask controller are",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"frozen"", this sounds to me like you're having some kind of two-timescale stochastic gradient",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,descent.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"updates when you move to the ""temporal abstractions"" setting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,I am inclined to believe that this approach has the potential to scale up to,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"very large domains, but paper currently does not demonstrate this",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,empirically.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"Like any typical reviewer, I would be tempted to say that",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,you should perform larger experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"However, I'm also glad that you have",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"shown that your system also performs well in a ""toy"" domain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,The characterization,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,in figure 3 is insightful and makes a good point for the analogy regularizer,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,and need for hierarchy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,"Overall, I think that the proposed architecture would inspire other researchers",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,and would be worth being presented at ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJttqw5ge,It also contains novel elements,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,SUMMARY.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,This paper proposes a new neural network architectures for solving the task of reading comprehension question answering where the goal is answering a questions regarding a given text passage.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The proposed model combines two well-know neural network architectures match-lstm and pointer nets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,First the passage and the questions are encoded with a unidirectional LSTM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,Then the encoded words in the passage and the encoded words in the questions are combined with an attention mechanism so that each word of the passage has a certain degree of compatibility with the question.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,For each word in the passage the word representation and the weighted representation of the query is concatenated and passed to an forward lstm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The same process is done in the opposite direction with a backward lstm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The final representation is a concatenation of the two lstms.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,As a decoded a pointer network is used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,"The authors tried with two approaches: generating the answer word by word, and generating the first index and the last index of the answer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The proposed model is tested on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,An ensemble of the proposed model achieves performance close to state-of-the-art models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,OVERALL JUDGMENT,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,I think the model is interesting mainly because of the use of pointer networks as a decoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,One thing that the authors could have tried is a multi-hop approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,It has been shown in many works to be extremely beneficial in the joint encoding of passage and query.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The authors can think of it as a deep match-lstm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The analysis of the model is interesting and insightful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-q5Pqxl,The sharing of the code is good.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,The main merit of this paper is to draw again attention to how crucial initialization of deep network *can* be; and to counter the popular impression that modern architectures and improved gradient descent techniques make optimization local minima and saddle points no longer a  problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"While the paper provides interesting counter-examples that showcase how bad initialization mixed with particular data can lead the optimization to get stuck at a poor solution, these feel like contrived artificial constructs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"More importantly the paper does not consider popular heuristics that likely help to avoid getting stuck, such as: non-saturating activation functions (e.g. leaky RELU), batch-norm, skip connections (resnet), that can all be thought of as contributing to keep the gradients flowing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The paper puts up a big warning sign about potential initialization problems (with standard RELU nets), but without proposing new solutions or workarounds, nor carrying out a systematic analysis of how this picture is affected by most commonly used current heuristic techniques (in architecture, initialization and training).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Such a broader scope analysis, especially if it did lead to insights of practical relevance, could much increase the value of the paper for the reader.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"This paper studies the error surface of deep rectifier networks, giving specific examples for which the error surface has local minima.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,Several experimental results show that learning can be trapped at apparent local minima by a variety of factors ranging from the nature of the dataset to the nature of the initializations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,This paper develops a lot of good intuitions and useful examples of ways that training can go awry.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Even though the examples constructed in this paper are contrived, this does not necessarily remove their theoretical importance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,It is very useful to have simple examples where things go wrong.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,However the broader theoretical framing of the paper appears to be going after a strawman.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"“The underlying easiness of optimizing deep networks does not simply rest just in the emerging structures due to high dimensional spaces, but is rather tightly connected to the intrinsic characteristics of the data these models are run on.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,I believe this perspective is already contained in several of the works cited as not belonging to this perspective.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Choromanska et al., for instance, analyze Gaussian inputs, and so clearly make claims based on characteristics of the data the models are run on.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"More broadly, the loss function is determined jointly by the dataset and the model parameters, and so no account of the error surface can be separated from dataset properties.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"It is not clear to me what ‘emerging structures due to high dimensional spaces’ are, or what they could be, that would make them independent of the dataset and initial model parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,The emerging structure of the error surface is necessarily related to the dataset and model parameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Again, a key worry with this paper is that it is aiming at a strawman: replica methods characterize average behavior for infinite systems, so it is not surprising that specific finite sized systems might yield poor optimization landscapes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The paper seems surprised that training can be broken with a bad initialization, but initialization is known to be critical, even for linear networks: saddle points are not innocuous, with bad initializations dramatically slowing learning (e.g. Saxe et al. 2014).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,It seems like the proof of proposition 5 may have an error.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,Suppose cdf_b(0) = 0 and cdf_W(0)=1/2.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,We have P(learning fails) >,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"= 1 - 1/2^{h^2(k-1)}, meaning that the probability of failure _increases_ as the number of hidden units increases.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,It seems like it should rather be (ignoring the bias) p(fails) >,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,= 1 - [ 1 - p(w<0)^h^2]^{k-1}.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"In this case the limit as k-> infinity depends on how h scales with k, so it is no longer necessarily true that “one does not have a globally good behaviour of learning regardless of the model size.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,The paper also appears to insufficiently distinguish between local minima and saddle points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Section 3.1 states it shows training being stuck in a local minimum, but this is based on training with a fixed budget of epochs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,It is not possible to tell whether this result reflects a genuine local minimum or a saddle point based on simulation results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"It may also be the case that, while rectifiers suffer from genuine blind spots, sigmoid or soft rectifier nonlinearities may not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"On the XOR problem with two hidden nodes, for instance, it was thought that were local minima but in fact there are none (e.g. L. Hamey, “Analysis of the error surface of the XOR network with two hidden nodes,” 1995).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"If the desire is simply to show that training does not converge for particular finite problems, much simpler counterexamples can be constructed and would suffice: set all hidden unit weights to zero, for instance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"In the response to prereview questions, the authors write ‘If the “complete characterization”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"[of the error surface] was indeed universally valid, we would not be able to break the learning with the initialization’",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"but, as mentioned previously, the basic results for even deep linear networks show that a bad initialization (at or near a saddle point) will break learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Again, it seems this paper is attacking a straw man along the lines of “nothing can possibly go wrong with neural network training.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,No prior theoretical result claims this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,The Figure 2 explanation seems counterintuitive to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"Simply scaling the input, if the weight matrices are initialized with zero biases, will not change the regions over which each ReLU activates.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"That is, this manipulation does not achieve the goal of concentrating “most of the data points in very few linear regions.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"A far more likely explanation is that the much weaker scaling has not been compensated by the learning algorithm, but the algorithm would converge if run longer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The response notes that training has been conducted for an order of magnitude longer than required for the unscaled input to converge, but the scaling on the data is not one but five orders of magnitude—and indeed the training does converge without issue for scaling up to four orders of magnitude.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The response notes that Adam should compensate for the scaling factor, but this depends on the details of the Adam implementation—the epsilon factor used to protect against division by zero, for example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"This paper contains many interesting results, but a variety of small technical concerns remain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,The paper studies some special cases of neural networks and datasets where optimization fails.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,Most of the considered models and datasets are however highly constructed and do not follow the basic hyperparameters selection and parameter initialization heuristics.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,This reduces the practical relevance of the analysis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The experiment ""bad initialization on MNIST"" shows that for very negative biases or weights drawn from a non-centered distribution, all ReLU activations are ""off"" for all data points, and thus, optimization is prevented.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"This never occurs in practice, because using proper initialization heuristics avoid these cases.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"The ""jellyfish"" dataset constructed by the authors is demonstrated to be difficult to fit by a small model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,"However, the size/depth of the considered model is unsuitable for this problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syoiqwcxx,Proposition 4 assumes that we can choose the mean from which the weight parameters are initialized.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,"Shows quite promising results on several datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,Weakness:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,"Limited architecture design choices due to many prior assumptions (e.g., a set of possible number of convolution filters, at most 2 fully-connected layers, maximum depth, hard-coded dropout, etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,"The method is demonstrated in tabular Q-learning setting, but it is unclear whether the proposed method would work in a large state-action space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,"Overall, this is an interesting and novel approach for neural network architecture design, and it seems to be worth publication despite some weaknesses.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,The paper looks solid and the idea is natural.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,Results seem promising as well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,I am mostly concerned about the computational cost of the method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,8-10 days on 10 GPUs for relatively tiny datasets is quite prohibitive for most applications I would ever encounter.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,I think the main question is how this approach scales to larger images and also when applied to more exotic and possibly tiny datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,Can you run an experiment on Caltech-101 for instance?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,I would be very curious to see if your approach is suitable for the low-data regime and areas where we all do not know right away how a suitable architecture looks like.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1c2cvqee,"For Cifar-10/100, MNIST and SVHN, everyone knows very well what a reasonable model initialization looks like.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,It seems likely that the behavior for much larger networks would be different.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"A reason for optimism, though, is the fact that a clear bulk/outlier behavior emerges even in these networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Characterizing this behavior for simple systems is valuable.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"This paper is attacking an important problem, but should do a better job situating itself in the related literature and undertaking experiments of sufficient size to reveal large-scale behavior relevant to practice.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"For example, regarding the concentration of eigenvalues to zero in Figure 6, it is unclear whether the concentration effect is really caused by training (e.g. increasing insensitivity to local perturbations), or the consequence of a specific choice of scale for the initial parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"In Figure 8, the complexity of the data is not defined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,It is not clear whether two fully overlapping distributions (the Hessian would then become zero?) is considered as complex or simple data.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Plots of Figure 3 don't have the same range for the x-axis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,The image of Hessian matrix of Figure 1 does not render properly in printed format.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,The work presents some empirical observations to support the statement that “the Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate”.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,But what does this statement refer to?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"To my understanding, there are at least three interpretations:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,(i),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any point in the parameter space, i.e., any network weight matrices.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,(ii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any critical point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"(iii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any local minimum, or any global minimum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,None of these interpretations is solidly supported by the observations provided in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,More comments are as follows:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,1) The authors state that “we don’t have much information on what the actual Hessian looks like.”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Then I just wonder what Hessian is investigated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Is it the actual one or approximate one?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Please clarify and provide the references for computing the actual Hessian.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"2) It is not clear whether the optimization was done by a batch gradient descent algorithm, i.e., batch back propagation (BP) algorithm, or a stochastic BP algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"If the training was done via a stochastic BP algorithm, it is hard to conclude that the the Neural Network has been trained to its local minimum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"When it was done by a full-batch BP algorithm, what was the accumulating point?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Was it local minimum or global minimum?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"3) Since the negative log likelihood function was used as at the end of training, it is essentially a joint learning approach in both the Newton weight matrices and the negative log likelihood vector.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"Certainly, the whole loss function is not convex in these two parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"But if least squares error function is used at the end, would it make any difference in claiming the degeneracy of the Hessian?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"4) Finally, the statement “There are still negative eigenvalues even when they are small in magnitude” is very puzzling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Potential reasons are:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,(a),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"If the training algorithm did converge, the accumulating points were not local minima, i.e., they were saddle points.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"(b) Training algorithms did not converge, or have not converged yet.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,(c) The calculation of the actual Hessian might be inaccurate.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"Studying the Hessian in deep learning, the experiments in this paper suggest that the eigenvalue distribution is concentrated around zero and the non zero eigenvalues are related to the complexity of the input data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,I find most of the discussions and experiments to be interesting and insightful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"However, the current paper could be significantly improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Quality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,It seems that the arguments in the paper could be enhanced by more effort and more comprehensive experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Performing some of the experiments discussed in the conclusion could certainly help a lot.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Some other suggestions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,1- It would be very helpful to add other plots showing the distribution of eigenvalues for some other machine learning method for the purpose of comparison to deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,2- There are some issues about the scaling of the weights and it make sense to normalize the weights each time before calculating the Hessian otherwise the result might be misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,3- It might worth trying to find a quantity that measures the singularity of Hessian because it is difficult to visually conclude something from the plots.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,4- Adding some plots for the Hessian during the optimization is definitely needed because we mostly care about the Hessian during the optimization not after the convergence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,Clarity:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,1- There is no reference to figures in the main text which makes it confusing for the reading to know the context for each figure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,"For example, when looking at Figure 1, it is not clear that the Hessian is calculated at the beginning of optimization or after convergence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B186cP9gx,2- The texts in the figures are very small and hard to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,The paper proposed a simple and effective model for QA.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,The paper is easy to read and result is impressive on the synthetic and real dataset.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,"The paper proposes a simplistic recurrent architecture that has a very small temporal dependence in its definition (which, in turn, allows it to be parallelized across the temporal axis).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,"Paper is clear to follow, the architecture has appropriate motivation and the experiments seem to be very thorough and over an appropriate range of synthetic and real datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,Results are very impressive on its own especially considering the simplicity of the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,Activation and gate visualizations are informative.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,"Overall, the work is sufficient as a conference contribution.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MRcPclx,"I would like the authors to also show results training on all tasks simultaneously, but other than that, I think it is an interesting model and it is nicely described and tested.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The paper presents an application of a tensor factorization to linear models, which allows to consider higher-order interactions between variables in classification (and regression) problems, and that maintains computational feasibility, being linear in the dimension.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The factorization employed is based on the TT format, first proposed by Oseledests (2011).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The authors also propose the adoption of a Riemannian optimization scheme to explicit consider the geometry of the tensor manifold, and thus speed up convergence.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The paper in general is well written, it presents an interesting application of the TT tensor format for linear models (together with an application of Riemannian optimization), which in my opinion is quite interesting since it has a wide range of possible applications in different algorithms in machine learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"On the other side, I have some concerns are about the experimental part, which I consider not at the level of the rest of the paper, for instance in terms of number of experiments on real datasets, role of dropout in real datasets, comparison with other algorithms on real datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,Moreover the authors do not take into account explicitly the problem of the choice of the rank to be used in the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,In general the experimental section seems a collection of preliminary experiments where different aspects have been tested by not in a organic way.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"I think the paper is close to a weak acceptance / weak rejection, I don't rate it as a full acceptance paper, mainly due to the non-satisfactory experiment setting.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,This paper introduces a polynomial linear model for supervised classification tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The model is based on a combination of the Tensor Train (TT) tensor decomposition method and a form of stochastic Riemannian  optimization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,A few empirical experiments are performed that demonstrate the good performance of the proposed model relative to appropriate baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"From a theoretical standpoint, I think the approach is interesting and elegant.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The main machinery underlying this work are the TT decomposition and the geometric structure of the manifold of tensors with fixed TT-rank, which have been established in prior work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The novelty of this paper is in the combination of this machinery to form an efficient polynomial linear model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"As such, I would have hoped that the paper mainly focused on the efficacy of this combination and how it is superior to obvious alternatives.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"For example, I would have really appreciated seeing how FMs performed when optimized over the manifold of positive definite matrices, as another reviewer mentioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"Instead, there is a bit too much effort devoted to explaining prior work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,I think the empirical analysis could be substantially improved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,I am particularly puzzled by the significant performance boost obtained from initializing with the ordinary logistic regression solution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"I would have liked some further analysis of this effect, especially whether or not it is possible to obtain a similar performance boost with other models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"Regarding the synthetic data, I think an important baseline would be against a vanilla feed forward neural network, which would help readers understand how complicated the interactions are and how difficult the dataset is to model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,I agree with the previous reviewer regarding a variety of other possible improvements to the experimental section.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"A few typos: 'Bernoulli distrbution', 'reproduce the experiemnts', 'generilize better'.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"Overall, I am on the fence regarding this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The main idea is quite good, but insufficient attention was devoted to analyzing the aspects of the model that make it interesting and novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,This paper proposes to use the tensor train (TT) decomposition to represent the full polynomial linear model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The TT form can reduce the computation complexity in both of inference and model training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,A stochastic gradient over a Riemann Manifold has been proposed to solve the TT based formulation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The empirical experiments validate the proposed method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The proposed approach is very interesting and novel for me.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,I would like to vote acceptance on this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,My only suggestion is to include the computational complexity per iteration.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The paper describes how to use a tensor factorization method called Tensor Train for modeling the interactions between features for supervised classification tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,Tensor Train approximates tensors of any dimensions using low rank products of matrices.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The rank is used as a parameter for controlling the complexity of the approximation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,Experiments are performed on different datasets for binary classification problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The core of the paper consists in demonstrating how the TT formalism developed by one of the authors could be adapted for modeling interactions between features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,Another contribution is a gradient algorithm that exploits the geometrical structure of the factorization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,These ideas are probably new in Machine learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The algorithm itself is of reasonable complexity for the inference and could probably be adapted to large size problems although this is not the case for the experiments here.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"The experimental section is not well structured, it is incomplete and could be improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,We miss a description of the datasets characteristics.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The same holds for the role of Dropout.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The comparison on the Movielens dataset is incomplete.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"Besides, all the tests are performed on small size problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"Overall, there are original contributions which could be worth a publication.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,The experiments are incomplete and not conclusive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYmiD9lg,"A more detailed comparison with competing methods, like Factorization Machines, could also improve the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,This paper extend the Spin Glass analysis of Choromanska et al. (2015a) to Res Nets which yield the novel dynamic ensemble results for Res Nets and the connection to Batch Normalization and the analysis of their loss surface of Res Nets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,The paper is well-written with many insightful explanation of results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,"Although the technical contributions extend the Spin Glass model analysis of the ones by Choromanska et al. (2015a), the updated version could eliminate one of the unrealistic assumptions and the analysis further provides novel dynamic ensemble results and the connection to Batch Normalization that gives more insightful results about the structure of Res Nets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,It is essential to show this dynamic behaviour in a regime without batch normalization to untangle the normalization effect on ensemble feature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,Hence authors claim that steady increase in the L_2 norm of the weights will maintain the this feature but setting for Figure 1 is restrictive to empirically support the claim.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,At least results on CIFAR 10 without batch normalization for showing effect of L_2 norm increase and results that support claims about Theorem 4 would strengthen the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,"This work provides an initial rigorous framework to analyze better the inherent structure of the current state of art Res Net architectures and its variants which can stimulate potentially more significant results towards careful understanding of current state of art models (Rather than always to attempting to improve the performance of Res Nets by applying intuitive incremental heuristics, it is important to progress on some solid understanding too).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,This paper shows how spin glass techniques that were introduced in Choromanska et al. to analyze surface loss of deep neural networks can be applied to deep residual networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,This is an interesting contribution but it seems to me that the results are too similar to the ones in Choromanska et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,and thus the novelty is seriously limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,Main theoretical techniques described in the paper were already introduced and main theoretical results mentioned there were in fact already proved.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,The authors also did not get rid of lots of assumptions from Choromanska et al.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,Specific Comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,"In the proof of Lemma 2, I'm not sure where the sequence beta comes from (I don't see how it follows from 11?)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,The ResNet structure used in the paper is somewhat different from normal with multiple layers being skipped?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,(Can the same analysis be used if only one layer is skipped?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,It seems like the skipping mostly affects the number of paths there are of a certain length?),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,The new experiments supporting the scale increase in practice are interesting!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8csP5ex,"I'm not sure about Theorems 3, 4 necessarily proving this link theoretically however, particularly given the simplifying assumption at the start of Section 4.2?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The paper tackles the task of music generation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"They use an orderless NADE model for the task of ""fill in the notes"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Given a roll of T timesteps of pitches, they randomly mask out some pitches, and the model is trained to predict the missing notes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,This follows how the orderless NADE model can be trained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"During sampling, one normally follows an ancestral sampling procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"For this, an ordering is defined over outputs, and one runs the model on the current input, samples one of the outputs according to the order, adds this output to the next input, and continues this procedure until all outputs have been sampled.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The key point of the paper is that this is a bad sampling strategy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Instead, they suggest the strategy of Yao et al. 2014, which uses a blocked Gibbs sampling approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"The blocked Gibbs strategy instead masks N inputs randomly and independently, samples them, and repeats this procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"The point of this strategy is the make sure the sampling chain mixes well, which will happen for large N. However, since the samples are independent, having a large N gives incoherent samples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Thus, the authors follow an annealed schedule for N, making it smaller over time, which will eventually reduce to ancestral sampling (giving global structure to the sample).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"They conduct a variety of experiments involving both normal metrics and human evaluations, and find that this blocked Gibbs sampling outperforms other sampling procedures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,This is a well written paper - great job.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"My main problem with the paper is that having read Uria and Yao, I don't know how much I have learned from this work in the context of this being an ICLR submission.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"If this was submitted to some computational music / art conference, this paper would be a clear accept.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"However, for ICLR, I don't see enough novelty compared with previous works this builds upon.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Orderless NADE is an established model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The blocked Gibbs sampling and annealing scheme are basically the exact same one used in Yao.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Thus, the main novelty of this paper is its application to the music domain, and finding that Yao's method works better for sampling music.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"This is a good contribution, but more tailored to those working in the music domain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"If the authors found that these results also hold for other domains like images (e.g. on CIFAR / tiny Imagenet) and text (e.g. document generation), then I would change my mind and accept this paper for ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Even just trying musical domains other than Bach chorales would be useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"However, as it stands, the experiments are not convincing enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The paper presents a way to model the distribution of four-part Bach chorales using Convolutional Neural Networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Furthermore it addresses the task of artificial music generation by sampling from the model using blocked Gibbs sampling and shows,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The CNN model for the distribution seems very appropriate for the data at hand.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Also the analysis of the proposed sampling schemes with the analogy between Gibbs sampling and human music composition are very interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,I am not too sure about the evaluation though.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Since the reported likelihoods are not directly comparable to previous work, I have difficulties judging the quality of the quantitative results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,For the human evaluation I would like to see the data for the direct comparisons between the models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,E.g. How did NADE vs. Bach perform.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Also I find the question: ‘what piece of music do you prefer’ a stronger test than the question ‘what piece is more musical to you’ because I don’t really know what ‘musical’ means to the AMT workers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Finally, while I think the Bach Chorales are interesting musical pieces that deserve to be subject of the analysis but I find it hard to judge how well this modelling approach will transfer to other types of music which might have a very different data distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"Nevertheless, in conclusion, I believe this is an exciting model for an interesting task that produces non-trivial musical data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"This paper proposed COCONET, which is a neural autoregressive model with convolution, to do music composition task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,This paper also proposed to use blocked Gibbs sampling instead of the ancestral sampling of the original NADE model to generate better pieces of music.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,The experimental results showed that the NLL of COCONET is better than the other baselines and the human evaluation task by Amazon’s Mechanical Turk illustrated that the model can generate compelling music.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"In general, I think the paper is good.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,Using NADE based model with convolution operations on music generation tasks and using blocked Gibbs sampling contains some kind of novelty.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Usiwcex,"However, the novelty of the paper is incremental, since the blocked Gibbs sampling for NADE model is already proposed by Yao et al., (2014) and the using NADE based model for music modeling has also been proposed by Boulanger-Lewandowski  et al., (2012).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,This paper proposes an RNN-based model for recommendation which takes into account temporal dynamics in user ratings and reviews.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Interestingly, the model infers time-dependant user/item vectors by applying an RNN to previous histories.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Those vectors are used to predict ratings, in a similar fashion to standard matrix factorization methods, and also bias a conditional RNN language model for reviews.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,The paper is well written and the architectural choices make sense.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,The main shortcomings of the paper are in the experiments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,1) The full model (rating+text) is only applied to one and relatively small dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Applying the model on multiple datasets with more data, e.g. Amazon reviews dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) would be more convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"2) While modelling order in review text seems like the right choice, previous papers (e.g. Almahairi et al. 2015) have shown that for rating prediction, modelling order in reviews might not be useful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"A comparison with a similar model, but with bag-of-words reviews model would be nice in order to show the importance of the RNN-based review model, especially given previous literature.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Finally, this paper is an application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques, and I do not feel the paper offers new insights which the ICLR community in general would benefit from.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"This is not to undermine the importance of this paper, but I would like the authors to comment on why they think ICLR is a good avenue for their work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,This paper proposed a joint model for rate prediction and text generation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"The author compared the methods on a more realistic time based split setting, which requires “predict into the future.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"One major flaw of the paper is that it does not address the impact of BOW vs the RNN based text model, specifically RRN(rating+text) already uses RNN for text modeling, so it is unclear whether the improvement comes from RNN(as opposed to BOW) or application of text information.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,A more clear study on impact of each component could make it more clear and benefit the readers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Another potential improvement direction of the paper is to support ranking objectives, as opposed to rate prediction, which is more realistic for recommendation settings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"The overall technique is intuitive and novel, but can be improved to give more insights to the reader,.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,The paper seeks to jointly model ratings and reviews in addition to temporal patterns.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Existing papers have captured these aspects previously, but what's novel here is the particular combination of parts and choice of techniques.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"In particular, the use of LSTMs as opposed to ""bag-of-words"" models that have previously been used when combining the same components.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"A criticism is made of existing models that use bag-of-words features as being too ""coarse"" to capture the real dynamics of reviews.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"This seems a valid criticsm, though it's not clear exactly what features those existing models miss.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Something missing from this paper is any interpretation of what the model ""learns"" that may explain its better performance.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Lots of work on temporal recommender systems uses a variety of hold-out strategies besides random sampling, e.g. holding out the final ratings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,Is there a methodological contribution associated with this change?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"The experiments evaluate the extent to which the model achieves good performance due to its ability to capture evolving temporal patterns at the level of items, and the ability of the model to capture additional dynamics from text.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,Text makes a small but significant contribution; I was surprised by how large an improvement is achieved given how little text was included.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"Overall this is a reasonably strong experimental comparison, though could be improved in two dimensions:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"(a) There's no comparison to models that use ratings + text (e.g. CoBaFi, JMARS, etc.).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"These methods have reported substantial improvements over rating-only models in the past, perhaps even larger improvements than what is reported here.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,Such an experiment is important given the claim that existing models (in particular bag-of-words models) are too coarse to capture the dynamics of text.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"(b) The restriction to movie datasets is okay, but these datasets are somewhat outliers when it comes to recommendation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"In particular, they're extremely dense datasets that support very parameter-rich models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,"I'd question whether the results would hold on sparser data (though in fact I'd suspect they would hold, since on a sparser dataset the contribution due to using reviews ought to be larger).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,Otherwise the experiments are fine.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HksioDcxl,Perplexity results are nice but essentially what we'd expect.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJF3iD9xe,But the authors have ignored the other kind of compositionality that is important to neural networks — specifically that relating the proposed notion of invariance to function composition seems important — i.e. under what conditions do compositions of invariant functions remain invariant?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJF3iD9xe,Clearly the authors target the more general case - but spending some time to explain how the particular case is an instance of the the general case would be a good use of space.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Authors propose a strategy for pruning weights with the eventual goal of reducing GFLOP computations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,The pruning strategy is well motivated using the taylor expansion of the neural network function with respect to the feature activations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,The obtained strategy removes feature maps that have both a small activation and a small gradient (eqn 7).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"(A) Ideally the gradient of the output with respect to the activation functions should be 0 at the optimal, but as a result of stochastic gradient evaluations this would practically never be zero.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Small variance in the gradient across mini-batches indicates that irrespective of input data the specific network parameter is unlikely to change - intuitively these are parameters that are closer to convergence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Parameters/weights that are close to convergence and also result in a small activation are intuitively good candidates for pruning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,This is essentially what eqn 7 conveys and is likely to be reason why just removing weights that result in small activations is not as good of a pruning strategy (as shown by results in the paper).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,There are two kind of differences in weights that are removed by activation v/s taylor expansion:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"1. Weights with high-activations but very low gradients will be removed by taylor expansion, but not by activation alone.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"2. Weights with low-activation but high gradients will be removed by activation criterion, but not by taylor expansion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,It will be interesting to analyze which of (1) or (2) contribute more to the differences in weights that are removed by the taylor expansion v/s activation criterion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Intuitively it seems that weight that satisfy (1) are important because they are converged and contribute significantly to network's activation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"It is possible that a modified criterion - eqn (7) + \lambda feature activation, (where \lambda needs to be found by cross-validation) may lead to even better results at the cost of more parameter tuning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(B),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Another interesting comparison is with the with the optimal damage framework - where the first order gradients are assumed to be zero and pruning is performed using the second-order information (also discussed by authors in the appendix).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,There is no comparison with optimal damage as authors claim it is memory and computation inefficient.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Back of envelope calculations suggest that this would result only in 50% increase in memory and computation during pruning, but no loss in efficiency during testing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Therefore from a standpoint of deployment, I don't think this missing comparison is justified.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(C) The eventual goal of the authors is to reduce GFLOPs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Some recent papers have proposed using lower precision computation for this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,A comparison in GFLOPs with lower precision v/s pruning would be a great.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,While both these approaches are complementary and it is expected that combining both of them can lead to superior performance than either of the two - it is unclear when we are operating in the low-precision regime how much pruning can be performed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Any analysis on this tradeoff would be great (but not necessary).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(D),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"On finetuning, authors report results of AlexNet and VGG on two different datasets - Flowers and Birds respectively.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Why is this the case?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,It would be great to see the results of both the networks on both the datasets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(E) Authors report there is only a small drop in performance after pruning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Suppose the network was originally trained with N iterations, and then M finetuning iterations were performed during pruning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,This means that pruned networks were trained for N + M iterations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,The correct comparison in accuracies would be if we the original network was also trained for N + M iterations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"In figure 4, does the performance at 100% parameters reports accuracy after N+M iterations or after N iterations?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Overall I think the paper is technically and empirically sound, it proposes a new strategy for pruning:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(1) Based on taylor expansion,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(2) Feature normalization to reduce parameter tuning efforts.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,(3) Iterative finetuning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"However, I would like to see some comparisons mentioned in my comments above.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,If those comparisons are made I would change my ratings to an accept.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,This paper presents a novel way of pruning filters from convolutional neural networks with a strong theoretical justification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,The proposed methods is derived from the first order Taylor expansion of the loss change while pruning a particular unit.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,This leads to simple weighting of the unit activation with its gradient w.r.t.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,loss function and performs better than simply using the activation magnitude as the heuristic for pruning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"This intuitively makes sense, as we would like to remove not only the filters with low activation, but also filters where the incorrect activation value would not have small influence on the target loss.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Authors thoroughly investigate multiple baselines, including an oracle which sets an upper bound on the target performance even though it is computationally expensive.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,The devised method seems to be quite elegant and authors show that it generalizes well on multiple tasks and is computationally more than feasible as it is easy to combine with traditional fine tuning procedure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"Also, the work clearly shows the trade-offs of increased speed and decreased performance, which is useful for practical applications.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"It would be also useful to compare against different baselines, e.g. [1].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,However this method seems to be more useful as it does not involve training of a new network (and thus is probably much faster).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Suggestion - maybe it can be extended in the future towards also removing only parts of the filters(e.g.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,for the 3D convolution)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,"This may be more complicated as it would need to change the implementation of convolution operator, but can lead to further speedup.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Authors propose a neural pruning technique starting from trained models using an approximation of change in the cost function and outperform other criteria.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Authors obtain solid speedups while maintaining reasonable accuracy thanks to finetuning after pruning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,Comparisons to existing methods is weak as GFLOPS graphs only show a couple simple baselines and no prior work baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl,I would be more convinced of the superiority of the approach with such comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Attempts to use chatbots for every form of human-computer interaction has been a major trend in 2016, with claims that they could solve many forms of dialogs beyond simple chit-chat.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,This paper represents a serious reality check.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"While it is mostly relevant for Dialog/Natural Language venues (to educate software engineer about the limitations of current chatbots), it can also be published at Machine Learning venues (to educate researchers about the need for more realistic validation of ML applied to dialogs), so I would consider this work of  high significance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Two important conjectures are underlying this paper and likely to open to more research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"While they are not in writing, Antoine Bordes clearly stated them during a NIPS workshop presentation that covered this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Considering the metrics chosen in this paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,1),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,The performance of end2end ML approaches is still insufficient for goal oriented dialogs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"2) When comparing algorithms, relative performance on synthetic data is a good predictor of performance on natural data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"This would be quite a departure from previous observations, but the authors made a strong effort to match the synthetic and natural conditions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"While its original algorithmic contribution consists in one rather simple addition to memory networks (match type), it is the first time these are deployed and tested on a goal-oriented dialog, and the experimental protocol is excellent.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,The overall paper clarity is excellent and accessible to a readership beyond ML and dialog researchers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"I was in particular impressed by how the short appendix on memory networks summarized them so well, followed by the tables that explained the influence of the number of hops.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"While this paper represents the state-of-the-art in the exploration of more rigorous metrics for dialog modeling, it also reminds us how brittle and somewhat arbitrary these remain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Note this is more a recommendation for future research than  for revision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,First they use the per-response accuracy (basically the next utterance classification among a fixed list of responses).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Looking at table 3 clearly shows how absurd this can be in practice: all that matters is a correct API call and a reasonably short dialog, though this would only give us a 1/7 accuracy, as the 6 bot responses needed to reach the API call also have to be exact.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Would the per-dialog accuracy, where all responses must be correct, be better?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Table 2 shows how sensitive it is to the experimental protocol.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"I was initially puzzled that the accuracy for subtask T3 (0.0) was much lower that the accuracy for the full dialog T5 (19.7), until the authors pointed me to the tasks definitions (3.1.1) where T3 requires displaying 3 options while T5 only requires displaying one.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"For the concierge data, what would happen if ‘correct’ meant being the best, not among the 5-best?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"While I cannot fault the authors for using standard dialog metrics, and coming up with new ones that are actually too pessimistic, I can think of one way to represent dialogs that could result in more meaningful metrics in goal oriented dialogs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Suppose I sell Virtual Assistants as a service, being paid upon successful completion of a dialog.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,What is the metric that would maximize my revenue?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"In this restaurant problem, the loss would probably be some weighted sum of the number of errors in the API call, the number of turns to reach that API call and the number of rejected options by the user.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"However, such as loss cannot be measured on canned dialogs and would either require a real human user or an realistic simulator",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Another issue closely related to representation learning that this paper fails to address or explain properly is what happens if the vocabulary used by the user does not match exactly the vocabulary in the knowledge base.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"In particular, for the match type algorithm to code ‘Indian’ as ‘type of cuisine’, this word would have to occur exactly in the KB.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"I can imagine situations where the KB uses some obfuscated terminology, and we would like ML to learn the associations rather than humans to hand-describe them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,SYNOPSIS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"All data is generated in the restaurant setting, where the goal is to find availability and eventually book a table based on parameters provided by the user to the bot as part of a dialog.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Data is generated by running a simulation using an underlying knowledge base to generate samples for the different parameters (cuisine, price range, etc), and then applying rule-based transformations to render natural language descriptions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"The objective is to rank a set of candidate responses for each next turn of the dialog, and evaluation is reported in terms of per-response accuracy and per-dialog accuracy.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,The authors show that Memory Networks are able to improve over basic bag-of-words baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,THOUGHTS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,I want to thank the authors for an interesting contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Having said that, I am skeptical about the utility of end-to-end trained systems in the narrow-domain setting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"In the open-domain setting, there is a strong argument to be made that hand-coding all states and responses would not scale, and hence end-to-end trained methods make a lot of sense.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"However, in the narrow-domain setting, we usually know and understand the domain quite well, and the goal is to obtain high user satisfaction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,Doesn't it then make sense in these cases to use the domain knowledge to engineer the best system possible?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Given that the domain is already restricted, I'm also a bit disappointed that the goal is to RANK instead of GENERATE responses, although I understand that this makes evaluation much easier.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,I'm also unsure how these candidate responses would actually be obtained in practice?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,It seems that the models rank the set of all responses in train/val/test (last sentence before Sec 3.2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Since a key argument for the end-to-end training approach is ease of scaling to new domains without having to manually re-engineer the system, where is this information obtained for a new domain in practice?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Generating responses would allow much better generalization to new domains, as opposed to simply ranking some list of hand-collected generic responses, and in my mind this is the weakest part of this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Finally, as data is generated using a simulation by expanding (cuisine, price, ...)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"tuples using NL-generation rules, it necessarily constrains the variability in the training responses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Of course, this is traded off with the ability to generate unlimited data using the simulator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,But I was unable to see the list of rules that was used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,It would be good to publish this as well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Overall, despite my skepticism, I think it is an interesting contribution worthy of publication at the conference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,I've updated my score following the clarifications and new results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"This paper presents a new, public dataset and tasks for goal-oriented dialogue applications.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"The dataset and tasks are constructed artificially using rule-based programs, in such a way that different aspects of dialogue system performance can be evaluated ranging from issuing API calls to displaying options, as well as full-fledged dialogue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"This is a welcome contribution to the dialogue literature, which will help facilitate future research into developing and understanding dialogue systems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Still, there are pitfalls in taking this approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"First, it is not clear how suitable Deep Learning models are for these tasks compared to traditional methods (rule-based systems or shallow models), since Deep Learning models are known to require many training examples and therefore performance difference between different neural networks may simply boil down to regularization techniques.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"The tasks 1-5 are also completely deterministic, which means evaluating performance on these tasks won't measure the ability of the models to handle noisy and ambiguous interactions (e.g. inferring a distribution over user goals, or executing dialogue repair strategies), which is a very important aspect in dialogue applications.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Overall, I still believe this is an interesting direction to explore.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"As discussed in the comments below, the paper does not have any baseline model with word order information.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"I think this is a strong weakness of the paper, because it makes the neural networks appear unreasonably strong, yet simpler baselines could very likely be be competitive (or better) than the proposed neural networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"To maintain a fair evaluation and correctly assess the power of representation learning for this task, I think it's important that the authors experiment with one additional non-neural network benchmark model which takes into account word order information.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,This would more convincly demonstrate the utility of Deep Learning models for this task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"For example, the one could experiment with a logistic regression model which takes as input 1) word embeddings (similar to the Supervised Embeddings model), 2) bi-gram features, and 3) match-type features.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"If such a baseline is included, I will increase my rating to 8.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"Final minor comment: in the conclusion, the paper states ""the existing work has no well defined measures of performances"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,This is not really true.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,End-to-end trainable models for task-oriented dialogue have well-defined performance measures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"See, for example ""A Network-based End-to-End Trainable Task-oriented Dialogue System"" by Wen et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"On the other hand, non-goal-oriented dialogue are generally harder to evaluate, but given human subjects these can also be evaluated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"In fact, this is what Liu et al (2016) do for Twitter.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,"See also, ""Strategy and Policy Learning for Non-Task-Oriented Conversational Systems"" by Yu et al.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Bb3D5gg,I've updated my score following the new results added in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The authors consider a simple optimization technique consisting of adding gradient noise with a specific schedule.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"They test their method on a number of recently proposed neural networks for simulating computer logic (end-to-end memory network, neural programmer, neural random access machines).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"On these networks, the question of optimization has so far not been studied as extensively as for more standard networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,A study specific to this class of models is therefore welcome.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,Results consistently show better optimization properties from adding noise in the training procedure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"One issue with the paper is that it is not clear whether the proposed optimization strategy permits to learn actually good models, or simply better than those that do not use noise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,A comparison to results obtained in the literature would be desirable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"For example, in the MNIST experiments of Section 4.1, the optimization procedure reaches in the most favorable scenario an average accuracy level of approximately 92%, which is still far from having actually learned an interesting problem representation (a linear model would probably reach similar accuracy).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"I understand that the architecture is specially designed to be difficult to optimize (20 layers of 50 HUs), but it would have been more interesting to consider a scenario where depth is actually beneficial for solving the problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,This paper presents a simple method of adding gradient noise to improve the training of deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"This paper first appeared on arXiv over a year ago and while there have been many innovations in the area of improving the training of deep neural networks in tha time (batch normalization for RNNs, layer normalization, normalization propagation, etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,this paper does not mention or compare to these methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"In particular, the authors state ""However, recent work on applying batch normalization to recurrent networks (Laurent et al., 2015) has not shown promise in improving generalization ability for recur- rent architectures, which are the focus of this work.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"This statement is simply incorrect and was thoroughly explored in, e.g. Cooijmans et al. (2016) that establish that batch normalization is effective for RNNs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The proposed method itself is extremely simple and is similar to numerous training strategies that have previously been advocated in the literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,As a result the contribution would be incremental at best and could be significant with sufficiently strong empirical results supporting this particular variant.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"However, as discussed above there are now multiple training strategies and algorithms in the literature that are not empirically compared.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"Unfortunately, this paper is now fairly seriously out of date.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,It would not be appropriate to publish this at ICLR 2017.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The authors propose to add noise to the gradients computed while optimizing deep neural networks with stochastic gradient based methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,They show results multiple data sets which indicate that the method can counteract bad parameter initialization and that it can be especially beneficial for training more complicated architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The method is tested on a multitude of different tasks and architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The results would be more convincing if they would be accompanied by confidence intervals but I understand that some of the experiments must have taken very long to run.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,I like that the results include both situations in which the gradient noise helps a lot and situations in which it doesn’t seem to add much to the other optimization or initialization tools employed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The quantity of the experiments and the variety of the models provide quite convincing evidence that the effect of the gradient noise generalizes to many settings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The results were not always that convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"In Section 4.2, the method only helped significantly when a sub-optimal training scheme was used, for example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The results on MNIST are not very good compared to the state-of-the-art.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"Since the method is so simple, I was hoping to see more theoretical arguments for its usefulness.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"That said, the experimental investigations into the importance of the annealing procedure, the comparison with the effect of gradient stochasticity and the comparison with weight noise, provide some additional insight.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The paper is well written and cites relevant prior work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"The proposed method is described clearly and concisely, which is to be expected given its simplicity.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The proposed idea is not very original.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"As the authors acknowledge, very similar algorithms have been used for training and it is pretty much identical to simulating Langevin dynamics but with the goal of finding a single optimum in mind rather than approximating an expected value.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The work is the evaluation of an old tool in a new era where models have become bigger and more complex.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"Despite the lack of novelty of the method, I do think that the results are valuable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,"The method is so easy to implement and seems to be so useful for complicated model which are hard to initialize, that it is important for others in the field to know about it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,I suspect many people will at least try the method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkjZ2Pcxe,The variety of the architectures and tasks for which the method was useful suggests that many people may also add it to their repertoire of optimization tricks.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"As someone who is interested in using this, what are the runtime considerations?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,I would strongly suggest to improve Fig.3.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"It mixes boxes, single symbols and illustrative figures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,It took some time to decipher the Figure and its flow.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"Summary: The paper is sufficiently clear, technical at many places and readability can be improved. E.g., the introduction of frames in the beginning lacks motivation and is rather unclear to someone new to this concept. The work falls in the general category of methods that impose knowledge about filter transformations into the network architecture. For me that has always two sides, the algorithmic and technical part (there are several ways to do this) and the practical side (should I do it)? This is a possible approach to this problem but after the paper I was a bit wondering what I have learned, I am certainly not inspired based on the content of the paper to integrate or build on this work. I am lacking insights into transformational parameters that are relevant for a problem. While the spatial transformer network paper was weaker on the technical elegance side, it provided exactly this: an insight into the feature transformation learned by the algorithm. I am missing this here, e.g., from Table 2  I learn that among four choices one works empirically better. What is destroyed by the x^py^p and Hermite frames that the ResNet is *not* able to recover from? You can construct network architectures that are the superset of both, so that inferior performance could be avoided.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,The algorithm is clear but it is similar to the Dynamic Filter Networks paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,And I am unfortunately not convinced about the usefulness of this particular formulation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"I'd expect a stronger paper with more insights into transformations and comparisons to standard techniques, a clear delineation of when this is advised.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,This works applies steerable frames for various tasks where convolutional neural networks with location invariant operators are traditionally applied.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,Authors provide a detailed overview of steerable frames followed with an experimental section which applies dynamic steerable network to small machine learning problems where the steerability is conceptually useful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"Even though the evaluation is performed only on few small tasks, the reason why more tasks were not evaluated is that piece-wise pose invariance is needed only for a subset of tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"The fact, that simply using overcomplete bases as a sort of ""feature pre-processing"" improves the results for already highly optimized ResNet and DenseNet architectures is quite interesting achievement.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"For the edge detection, a relatively hard baseline is selected - the Dynamic Filter Networks, which already attempts to achieve position invariant filters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,The fact that DSFN improves the performance on this task verifies that regressing the parametrization of the steerable filters yields better results than regressing the filters directly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,In the last experiment authors apply the network to video classification using LSTMs and they show that the improved performance is not due to increased capacity of the network.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H178hw9ex,"* For the LSTM experiment, in order to be more exact, it would be useful to include information about total number of parameters, as the network which estimates the pose also increases the number of parameters.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Strengths,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,This paper explores an interesting way to evaluate representations in terms of,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"their generalizability to out-of-domain data, as opposed to more standard",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,methods which use train and test data drawn from the same distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Experiments show that the predictions of deep unsupervised learning models on,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Weaknesses,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"Based on Fig 4, it seems that the models trained on 3 blocks (3CD, 3CLD)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"``generalize"" to 4 and 5 blocks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"However, it is plausible that these models",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,only pay attention to the bottom 3 blocks of the 4 or 5 block towers in order to,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,determine their stability.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,This would work correctly a significant fraction of,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,the time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"Therefore, the models might actually be overfitting to 3 block towers",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,and not really generalizing the physics of these blocks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Is this a possibility ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,I think more careful controls are needed to make the claim that the features,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,actually generalize.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"For example, test the 3 block model on a 5 block test set",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,but only make the 4th or 5th block unstable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"If the model still works well, then",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,we could argue that it is actually generalizing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,The experimental analysis seems somewhat preliminary and can be improved.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"particular, it would help to see visualizations of what the final state looks",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,That would,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,help understand if the generalization is really working.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,The discriminative,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,*** Paper Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,The paper proposes to learn a predictive model (aka predict the next video frames given an input image) and uses the prediction from this model to improve a supervised classifier.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,*** Review Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,This work seems rather preliminary in terms of experimentation and using forward modeling as pretraining has already been proposed and applied to video and text classification tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Discussion on related work is insufficient.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,The end task choice (will there be motion?) might not be the best to advocate for unsupervised training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,*** Detailed Review ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,This work seems rather preliminary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,There is no comparison with alternative semi-supervised strategies.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Any approach that consider the next frames as latent variables (or privileged information) can be considered.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Also I am not sure if the supervised stability prediction model is actually needed once the next frame is predicted.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Basically the task can be reduced to predict whether there will be motion in the video following the current frame or not (for instance comparing the first frame and last prediction or the density of gray in the top part of the video might work just as well).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Also training a model to predict the presence of motion from the unsupervised data only would probably do very well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"I would suggest to stir away from task where the label can be inferred trivially from the unsupervised data, meaning that unlabeled videos can be considered labeled frames in that case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"The related work section misses a discussion on previous work on learning unsupervised features from video (through predictive models, dimensionality reduction...) for helping classification of still images or videos [Fathi et al 2008; Mabahi et al 2009; Srivastava et al 2015].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"More recently, Wang and Gupta (2015) have obtained excellent ImageNet results from features pre trained on unlabeled videos.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,Vondrick et al (2016) have shown that generative models of video can help initialize models for video classification tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"Also in the field of text classification, pre training of classifier with a language model is a form predictive modeling, e.g. Dai & Le 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,I would also suggest to report test results on the dataset from Lerrer et al 2016 (I understand that you need your own videos to pre train the predictive model) but stability prediction only require still images.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,"Overall, I feel the experimental section is too preliminary.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ6DhP5xe,It would be better to focus on a task where solving the unsupervised task does not necessarily imply that the supervised task is trivially solved (or conversely that a simple rule can turn the unlabeled data into label data).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,This paper describe an implementation of delayed synchronize SGD method for multi-GPU deep ne training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,Comments,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,1) The described manual implementation of delayed synchronization and state protection is helpful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"However, such dependency been implemented by a dependency scheduler, without doing threading manually.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,2) The overlap of computation and communication is a known technique implemented in existing solutions such as TensorFlow(as described in Chen et.al) and MXNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,The claimed contribution of this point is somewhat limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,3),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,The convergence accuracy is only reported for the beginning iterations and only on AlexNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,It would be more helpful to include convergence curve till the end for all compared networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"In summary, this is paper implements a variant of delayed SyncSGD approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,I find the novelty of the system somewhat limited (due to comment (2)).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,The experiments should have been improved to demonstrate the advantage of proposed approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,The authors present methods to speed-up gradient descent by leveraging asynchronicity in a layer-wise manner.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"While they obtain up-to 1.7x speedup compared to synchronous training, their baseline is weak.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"More importantly, they dismiss parameter-server based methods, which are becoming standard, and so effectively just do not compare to the current state-of-the-art.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,They also do not present wall-time measurements.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"With these flaws, the paper is not ready for ICLR acceptance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,This paper is relatively difficult to parse.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"Much of the exposition of the proposed algorithm could be better presented using pseudo-code describing the compute flow, or a diagram describing exactly how the updates take place.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"As it stands, I'm not sure I understand everything.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"I would also have liked to see exactly described what the various labels in Fig 1 correspond to (""SGD task-wise, 1 comm""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,Did you mean layer-wise?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"There are a couple of major issues with the evaluation: first, no comparison is reported against baseline async methods such as using a parameter server.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"Second, using AlexNet as a benchmark is not informative at all.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,"AlexNet looks very different from any SOTA image recognition model, and in particular it has many fewer layers, which is especially relevant to the discussion in 6.3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkFd2P5gl,It also uses lots of fully-connected layers which affect the compute/communication ratios in ways that are not relevant to most interesting architectures today.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"In this work, the authors propose to use a (perhaps deterministic) retrieval function to replace uniform sampling over the train data in training the discriminator of a GAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"Although I like the basic idea, the experiments are very weak.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"There are essentially no quantitative results, no real baselines, and only a small amount of not especially convincing qualititative results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,It is honestly hard to review the paper- there isn't any semblance of normal experimental validation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Note:  what is happening with the curves in fig.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,6?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,This paper proposes a model that generates a latent representation of input image(s) and optimizes a reconstruction loss with an adversarial loss (Eq (1)) over nearest neighbors from a bank of images (“memory”).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The framework is adapted to three tasks: (i) image in-painting, (ii) intrinsic image decomposition, (iii) figure-ground layer extraction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Qualitative results are shown for all three tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,I think the proposed model has potential merits.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,I particularly like the fact that it seems to be reasoning over image composites via matching against a bank of images (somewhat similar to “Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites” work in NIPS 2009).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"However, I won’t champion the paper as the overall clarity and evaluation could be improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,More detailed comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,I believe the fatal flaw of the paper is there is no quantitative evaluation of the approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"At the very least, there should be a comparison against prior work on intrinsic image decomposition (e.g., SIRFS, maybe benchmark on ""intrinsic images in the wild” dataset).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,I found the writing vague and confusing throughout.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"For instance, “memory database” could mean a number of things, and in the end it seems that it’s simply a set of images.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,“Imagination” is also vague.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"On page 4, R(M,x) has the database and input image as arguments, but Fig 2 doesn’t show the input image as an input to R.  The contributions listed on page 3 should be tightened (e.g., it’s not clear what “Relevant memory retrieval for informative adversarial priors” means).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Fig 3 seems inconsistent with Fig 2 as the module for “memory database” is not present.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The fully-convolutional discriminator could use more details; one possibility is to provide a cost function.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The paper describes a network architecture for inverse problems in computer vision.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"Example inverse problems considered are image inpainting, computing intrinsic image decomposition and foreground/background separation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The architecture is composed of (i) a generator that produces target (latent) output (such as foreground / background regions),",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"(ii) renderer that composes that latent output back to the image that can be compared with the input to measure reconstruction error,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,and (iii) adversarial prior that ensures the target output (latent) image respects a certain image statistics.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Strong  points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The proposed architecture with memory database is interesting and appears to be novel.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Weak points:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Experimental results are only proof-of-concept in toy set-ups and do not clearly demonstrate benefits of the proposed architecture.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,It is unclear whether the memory retrieval engine that retrieves images based on L2 distance on pixel values is going generalize to other more realistic scenarios.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Clarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The clarity of explanation can be also improved (see below).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Detailed evaluation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Originality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The novelty of this work lies in the (iii) adversarial prior that places an adversarial loss between the generated latent output and a single image retrieved from a large unlabelled database of target output examples (called memory).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The adversarial prior has a convolutional form matching local image statistics, rather than the entire image.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The particular form of network architecture with the memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss appears to be novel and potentially interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Motivation for the Architecture.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The weakest point of the proposed architecture is the ""Memory retrieval engine"" R (section 2.4),",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,where images are retrieved from the memory by measuring L2 distance on pixel intensities.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"While this maybe ok for simple problems considered in this work, it is unclear how this can generalize to other more complicated datasets and problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"This should be better discussed, better justified and ideally results in some more realistic set-up shown (see below).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Quality:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"Results are shown for inpainting of MNIST digits, intrinsic image decomposition on the MIT intrinsic image database, and figure/ground layer extraction on the synthesized dataset of 3D chairs rendered onto background from real photographs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The experimental validation of the model is not very strong and proof-of-concept only.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,All the experiments are performed in simplified toy set-ups.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The MNIST digit inpainting is far from current state-of-the-art on image inpainting in real photographs (see e.g. Pathak et al., 2016).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,The foreground background separation is done on  only synthetically generated test data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"Even for intrinsic image demposition problem there is now relatively large-scale dataset of (Bell et al., 2014), see the citation below.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"While this is probably ok for the ICLR paper, it diminishes the significance of the work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Is this model going to be useful in a real settings?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,One possibility to address this would be to focus on one of the problems and show results on a challenging state-of-the-art data.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,Overall:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"The proposed architecture seems novel and potentially interesting, but experiments are only proof-of-concept and clarity can be improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,It is unclear whether the memory matching engine will generalize to other more complicated datasets and problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H13F3Pqll,"Overall, I am on the edge with this paper, giving the authors the benefit of doubt with a score slightly above the threshold.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,This paper addresses one of the major shortcomings of generative adversarial networks - their lack of mechanism for evaluating held-out data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"While other work such as BiGANs/ALI address this by learning a separate inference network, here the authors propose to change the GAN objective function such that the optimal discriminator is also an energy function, rather than becoming uninformative at the optimal solution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Training this new objective requires gradients of the entropy of the generated data, which are difficult to approximate, and the authors propose two methods to do so, one based on nearest neighbors and one based on a variational lower bound.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The results presented show that on toy data the learned discriminator/energy function closely approximates the log probability of the data, and on more complex data the discriminator give a good measure of quality for held out data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"I would say the largest shortcomings of the paper are practical issues around the scalability of the nearest neighbors approximation and accuracy of the variational approximation, which the authors acknowledge.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Also, since entropy estimation and density estimation are such closely linked problems, I wonder if any practical method for EGANs will end up being equivalent to some form of approximate density estimation, exactly the problem GANs were designed to circumvent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Nonetheless, the elegant mathematical exposition alone makes the paper a worthwhile contribution to the literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Also, some quibbles about the writing - it seems that something is missing in the sentence at the top of pg.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"5 ""Finally, let's whose discriminative power"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,I'm not sure what the authors mean to say here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,And the title undersells the paper - it makes it sound like they are making a small improvement to training an existing model rather than deriving an alternative training framework.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The authors present a method for changing the objective of generative adversarial networks such that the discriminator accurately recovers density information about the underlying data distribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,In the course of deriving the changed objective they prove that stability of the discriminator is not guaranteed in the standard GAN setup but can be recovered via an additional entropy regularization term.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The paper is clearly written, including the theoretical derivation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The derivation of the additional regularization term seems valid and is well explained.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The experiments also empirically seem to support the claim that the proposed changed objective results in a ""better"" discriminator.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,There are only a few issues with the paper in its current form:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The presentation albeit fairly clear in the details following the initial exposition in 3.1 and the beginning of 3.2 fails to accurately convey the difference between the energy based view of training GANs and the standard GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,As a result it took me several passes through the paper to understand why the results don't hold for a standard GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"I think it would be clearer if you state the connections up-front in 3.1 (perhaps without the additional f-gan perspective) and perhaps add some additional explanation as to how c() is implemented right there or in the experiments (you may want to just add these details in the Appendix, see also comment below).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The proposed procedure will by construction only result in an improved generator and unless I misunderstand something does not result in improved stability of GAN training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"You also don't make such a claim but an uninformed reader might get this wrong impression, especially since you mention improved performance compared to Salimans et al. in the Inception score experiment.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,It might be worth-while mentioning this early in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The experiments, although well designed, mainly convey qualitative results with the exception of the table in the appendix for the toy datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,I know that evaluating GANs is in itself not an easy task but I wonder whether additional more quantitative experiments could be performed to evaluate the discriminator performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"For example: one could evaluate how well the final discriminator does separate real from fake examples, how robust its classification is to injected noise (e.g. how classification accuracy changes for noised training data).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,Further one might wonder whether the last layer features learned by a discriminator using the changed objective are better suited for use in auxiliary tasks (e.g. classifying objects into categories).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,Main complaint: It is completely unclear what the generator and discriminators look like for the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,You mention that code will be available soon but I feel like a short description at least of the form of the energy used should also appear in the paper somewhere (perhaps in the appendix).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The submission explores several alternatives to provide the generator function in generative adversarial training with additional gradient information.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The exposition starts by describing a general formulation about how this additional gradient information (termed K(p_gen) could be added to the generative adversarial training objective function (Equation 1).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Next, the authors prove that the shape of the optimal discriminator does indeed depend on the added gradient information (Proposition 3.1), which is unsurprising.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Finally, the authors propose three particular alternatives to construct K(p_gen): the negative entropy of the generator distribution, the L2 norm of the generator distribution, and a constant function (which resembles the EBGAN objective of Zhao et al, 2016).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The exposition moves then to an experimental evaluation of the method, which sets K(p_gen) to be the approximate entropy of the generator distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"At this point, my intuition is that the objective function under study is the vanilla GAN objective, plus a regularization term that encourages diversity (high entropy) in the generator distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,The hope of the authors is that this regularization will transform the discriminator into an estimate of the energy landscape of the data distribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The experimental evaluation proceeds by 1) showing the contour plots of the obtained generator distribution for a 2D problem, 2) studying the generation diversity in MNIST digits, and 3) showing some samples for CIFAR-10 and CelebA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The 2D problem results are convincing, since one can clearly observe that the discriminator scores translate into unnormalized values of the density function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The MNIST results offer good intuition also: the more prototypical digits are assigned larger scores (unnormalized densities) by the discriminator, and the less prototypical digits are assigned smaller scores.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"The sample experiments from Section 5.3 are less convincing, since no samples from baseline models are provided for comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"To this end, I would recommend the authors to clarify three aspects.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"First, we have seen that entropy regularization leads to a discriminator that estimates the energy landscape of the data distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"But, how does this regularization reshape the generator function?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"It would be nice to see the mean MNIST digit according to the generator, and some other statistics if possible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Second, how do the samples produced by the proposed methods compare (visually speaking) to the state-of-the art?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Third, what are the *shortcomings* of this method versus vanilla GAN?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,Too much computational overhead?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,What are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two entropy estimators proposed in the manuscript?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"Overall, a clearly written paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,I vote for acceptance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxeqhP9ll,"As an open question to the authors: What breakthroughs should we pursue to derive a GAN objective where the discriminator is an estimate of the data density function, after training?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By1snw5gl,The paper proposes a new second-order method L-SR1 to train deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By1snw5gl,It is claimed that the method addresses two important optimization problems in this setting: poor conditioning of the Hessian and proliferation of saddle points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By1snw5gl,The method can be viewed as a concatenation of SR1 algorithm of Nocedal & Wright (2006) and limited-memory representations Byrd et al. (1994).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWWpw5ex,Roughly speaking the contributions are as follows:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWWpw5ex,I hadn't quite followed the issue mentioned in the pre-review discussion that the model requires multiple interactions per userXitem pair in order to fit the model (e.g. a user interacts with the same business multiple times).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWWpw5ex,This is a slightly unusual setting compared to most temporal recommender systems work.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"To that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,This is not unreasonable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see ""Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation"" by Leordeanu et al., ""EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow"" by Revaud et al., ""Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers"" by Sevilla-Lara et al.).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"While I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,Specifically:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very ""convenient"", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead, it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion. Which appears to be the case on UCF101 videos.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- Even ignoring the weird proxy-evaluation part, the network is still not trained end-to-end. That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for which an (exact) ground-truth is available. It is true that the MSE loss on raw pixels leads to blurry results, but other types of losses do exist, for instance the gradient loss introduced by Mathieu et al. was shown to solve this issue. As noted by the authors themselves, minimizing a loss in the transformation space, where affine parameters are harder to intepret, introduces unexpected artifacts. The motion is often largely underestimated, as is obvious in Figure 5 where it is hard to tell the difference between the input and output frames.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- The proposed approach is not sufficiently compared to previous work.

Experimental results should compare against it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxAAvcxx,"- The comparison with optical flow is unfair. First, the approach of Brox et al. is more than 10 years old. Second, it is not really fair to assume a constant flow for all frames. At least some basic extrapolation could be done to take into account the flow of all pairs of input frames and not just the last one. Overall, the approach is not compared to very challenging baselines.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper is well-written and easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,NOVELTY,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,This paper is the first to my knowledge to empirically measure the number of bits of information that can be stored per learnable parameter.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The idea of measuring network capacity by finding the dataset size and other hyperparameters that maximizes mutual information is a particularly novel experimental setup.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,SIGNIFICANCE,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,I have mixed feelings about the significance of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"I found the experiments interesting, but I don’t feel that they reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected about recurrent networks; it is hard to see how any of the experimental results will change the way either that I think about RNNs, or the way that I will use them in my own future work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"On the other hand it is valuable to see intuitive results about RNNs confirmed by rigorous experiments, especially since few researchers have the computational resources to perform such large-scale experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The capacity experiments (both per-parameter capacity and per-unit capacity) essentially force the network to model random data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"For most applications of RNNs, however, we do not expect them to work with random data; instead when applied in machine translation or language modeling or image captioning or any number of real-world tasks, we hope that RNNs can learn to model data that is anything but random.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,SUMMARY,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,PROS,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper is the first of my knowledge to explicitly measure the bits per parameter that RNNs can store,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper experimentally confirms several intuitive ideas about RNNs:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,- RNNs of any architecture can store about one number per hidden unit from the input,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"- Different RNN architectures should be compared by their parameter count, not their hidden unit count",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"- With very careful hyperparameter tuning, all RNN architectures perform about the same on text8 language modeling",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,- Gated architectures are easier to train than non-gated RNNs,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,CONS,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,Experiments do not reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The UGRNN and +RNN architectures do not feel well-motivated,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The utility of the UGRNN and +RNN architectures is not well-established,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The authors investigate a variety of existing and two new RNN architectures to obtain more insight about the effectiveness at which these models can store task information in their parameters and activations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The experimental setups look sound.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,To generalize comparisons between different architectures it’s necessary to consider multiple tasks and control for the effect of the hyperparameters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"This work uses multiple tasks of varying complexities, principled hyperparameter tuning methodology and a number of tuning iterations that can currently only be achieved by the computational resources of some of the larger industrial research groups.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The descriptions of the models and the objective where very clear to me.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"The descriptions of the experiments and presentation of the results were not always clear to me at times, even with the additional details in the appendix available.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,Most of these issues can easily be resolved by editing the text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"For example, in the memory task the scaling of the inputs (and hence also outputs) is not provided so it’s hard to interpret the squared error scores in Figure 2c.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,It’s not clear to me what the term ‘unrollings’ refers to in Figure 2b.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,Is this a time lag with additional hidden state updates between the presentation of the input sequence and the generation of the output?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"Since the perceptron capacity task is somewhat central to the paper, I think a slightly more precise description of how and when the predictions are computed would be helpful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"Due to the large number of graphs, it can be somewhat hard to find the most relevant results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,Perhaps some of the more obvious findings (like Figure 1(b-d) given Figure 1a) could move to the appendix to make space for more detailed task descriptions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,Novelty is not really the aim of this paper since it mostly investigates existing architectures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,To use the mutual information to obtain bits per parameter scores in highly non-linear parameterized functions is new to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper also proposed to new architectures that seem to have practical value.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper adds to the currently still somewhat neglected research effort to employ the larger computational resources we currently have towards a better understanding of architectures which were designed when such resources were not yet available.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,I’d argue that the paper is original enough for that reason alone.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The paper provides some interesting new insights into the properties of RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,"While observed before, it is interesting to see the importance of gated units for maintaining trainability of networks with many layers.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,It is also interesting to see a potential new use for vanilla RNNs for simpler tasks where a high capacity per parameter may be required due to hardware constraints.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The proposed +RNN may turn out to have practical value as well and the hyperparameter robustness results shed some light on the popularity of certain architectures when limited time for HP tuning is available.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BydARw9ex,The large body of results and hyperparameter analysis should be useful to many researchers who want to use RNNs in the future.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx,This paper presents a new theoretically-principled method of representing sentences as vectors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx,"The experiments show that vectors produced by this method perform well on similarity and entailment benchmarks, surpassing some RNN-based methods too.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx,I would like to see some more discussion on why such a simple model does better than LSTMs at capturing similarity and entailment.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx,Could this be an artifact of these benchmarks?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,The authors proposed to learn embeddings of users and items by using deep neural network for a recommendation task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"The resulting method has only minor differences from the previous CDL, in which neural networks were also used for recommendation tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"In the experiments, since the proposed method, DualNets have use more item features than WMF and CDL, the comparisons are unfair.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,This paper provides a minor improvement paper of DeepRS.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,The major improvement comes from the coupling of user-item factors in prediction.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,Another important missing part of the paper seems to be time complexity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"Since coupled net would be much more costly to generate recommendations, a discussion on how it would impact real world usages should be added.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"Overall, I think this is a paper that should be improved before accepted.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,The responses to the pre-review questions are not strong; especially w.r.t.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"the question about dataset density and why the dataset had to be subsampled, the authors responded that subsampling is common in recommender systems work, including the papers cited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"This isn't a particularly strong justification of why subsampling is a good idea, and in particular doesn't answer the question of ""how would the results look without subsampling,"" which I think is a question that could easily have been answered directly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"Especially given that the goal of dealing with the cold-start issue is so heavily emphasized in the paper, in seems odd to sample the data to reduce sparsity.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,1) The evaluation is unusual.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"Recall@M is the only result reported, though this is not usually an evaluation seen in recommender systems research.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"At the very least other performance measures (rmse or AUC) should be reported for completeness, even if the results are not strong",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"2) Given that the contribution is fairly simple (i.e., the ""standard"" recommender systems task, but with a new model)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,it's a shame that unusual data samples have to be taken.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"This should be a case where it's possible to report results against competing methods using *exactly* the same data they used, and exactly the same error measure, for the fairest comparison possible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1w7Jdqxl,"Without the above it's hard to tell how much the performance improvements are really due to the method being better, versus the choice of datasets and the choice of loss functions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"The paper presents a hardware accelerator architecture for deep neural network inference, and a simulated performance evaluation thereof.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,The central idea of the proposed architecture (PRA) revolves around the fact that the regular (parallel) MACC operations waste a considerable amount of area/power to perform multiplications with zero bits.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Since in the DNN scenario, one of the multiplicands (the weight) is known in advance, the multiplications by the zero digits can be eliminated without affecting the calculation and lowest non-zero bits can be further dropped at the expense of precision.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,The paper proposes an architecture exploiting this simple idea implementing bit-serial evaluation of multiplications with throughput depending on the number of non-zero bits in each weight.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"While the idea is in general healthy, it is limited to fixed point arithmetics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Nowadays, DNNs trained on regular graphics hardware have been shown to work well in floating point down to single (32bit) and even half-precision (16bit) in many cases with little or no additional adjustments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"However, this is generally not true for 16bit (not mentioning 8bit) fixed point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Since it is not trivial to quantize a network to 16 or 8 bits using standard learning, recent efforts have shown successful incorporation of quantization into the training process.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,One of the extreme cases showed quanitzation to 1bit weights with negligible loss in performance (arXiv:1602.02830).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"1-bit DNNs involve no multiplication at all; moreover, the proposed multiplier-dependent representation of multiplication discussed in the present paper can be implemented as a 1-bit DNN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,I think it would be very helpful if the authors could address the advantages their architecture brings to the evaluation of 1-bit DNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"To summarize, I believe that immediately useful hardware DNN accelerators still need to operate in floating point (a good example are Movidius chips",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,nowadays Intel).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Fixed point architectures promise additional efficiency and are important in low-power applications, but they depend very much on what has been done at training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,In view of this,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,and this is my own extreme opinion,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,it makes sense to build an architecture for 1-bit DNNs.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,My main question is about the choice of technology.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,What struck me is that your paper contains very few implementation details except for the technology (PRA 65nm vs DaDianNao 28nm).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Combined with the fact that the main improvement of your work appears to be performance rather than energy efficiency, I was wondering about the maximum clock estimated frequency of the PRA implementation due to the added complexity?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"Based on the explanation in the methodology section, I assume that the performance comparison is based on number of clock cycles.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,Do you have any numbers/estimates about the performance in practices (taking into account clock frequency)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=By14kuqxx,"An interesting idea, and seems reasonably justified and well-explored in the paper, though this reviewer is no expert in this area, and not familiar with the prior work.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkJq1Ocxl,The point of having sketches/partial programs is that one can learn more complex programs than starting from scratch (with no prior information).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkJq1Ocxl,The loss that they optimize (end to end through the program flow) is a L2 (RMSE) of the program memory (at targeted/non-masked adresses) and the desired output.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,SUMMARY.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,The paper proposes a gating mechanism to combine word embeddings with character-level word representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,The gating mechanism uses features associated to a word to decided which word representation is the most useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,"The fine-grain gating is applied as part of systems which seek to solve the task of cloze-style reading comprehension question answering, and Twitter hashtag prediction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,"For the question answering task, a fine-grained reformulation of gated attention for combining document words and questions is proposed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,"In both tasks the fine-grain gating helps to get better accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the CBT dataset and performing on-par with state-of-the-art approach on the SQuAD dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,OVERALL JUDGMENT,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,This paper proposes a clever fine-grained extension of a scalar gate for combining word representation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,It is clear and well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,It covers all the necessary prior work and compares the proposed method with previous similar models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,I liked the ablation study that shows quite clearly the impact of individual contributions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,"And I also liked the fact that some (shallow) linguistic prior knowledge e.g., pos tags ner tags, frequency etc. has been used in a clever way.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1hdzd5lg,It would be interesting to see if syntactic features can be helpful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"The authors propose transfer learning variants for neural-net-based models, applied to a bunch of NLP tagging tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"The field of multi-tasking is huge, and the approaches proposed here do not seem to be very novel in terms of machine learning: parts of a general architecture for NLP are shared, the amount of shared ""layers"" being dependent of the task of interest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,The novelty lies in the type of architecture which is used in the particular setup of NLP tagging tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,The experimental results show that the approach seems to work well when there is not much labeled data available (Figure 2).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Table 3 show some limited improvement at full scale.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Figure 2 results are debatable though: it seems the authors fixed the architecture size while varying the amount of labeled data; it is very likely that tuning the architecture for each size would have led to better results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Overall, while the paper reads well, the novelty seems a bit limited and the experimental section seems a bit disappointing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Authors' response well answered my questions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Thanks!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Evaluation not changed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,###,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"This paper proposes a hierarchical framework of transfer learning for sequence tagging, which is expected to help the target task with the source task, by sharing as many levels of representation as possible.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,It is a general framework for various neural models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"The paper has extensive and solid experiments, and the performance is competitive with the state of the art on multiple benchmark datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"The framework is clear by itself, except that more details about training procedure, i.e. sec-3.3, need to be added.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"The experimental results show that for some task pairs {s,t}, this framework can help low-resource target task t, and the improvement increases with more levels of representations can be shared.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Firstly, I suggest that the terms *source* and *target* should be more precisely defined in the current framework, because, due to Sec-3.3, the s and t in each pair are sort of interchangeable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"That is, either of them can be the *source* or *target* task, especially when p(X=s)=p(X=t)=0.5 is used in the task sampling.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,The difference is: one is low-resourced and the other is not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Thus it could be thought of as multi-tasking between tasks with imbalanced resource.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"So one question is: does this framework simultaneously help both tasks in the pair, by learning more generalizable representations for different domains/applications/languages?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Or is it mostly likely to only help the low-resourced one?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,Does it come with sacrifice on the high-resourced side?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Secondly, as the paper shows that the low-resourced tasks are improved for the selected task pairs, it would also be interesting and helpful to know how often this could happen.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"That is, when the tasks are randomly paired (one chosen from a low-resource pool and the other from a high resource pool), how often could this framework help the low-resourced one?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Moreover, the choice of T-A/T-B/T-C lies intuitively in how many levels of representation *could* be shared as possible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"This implicitly assumes share more, help more.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Although I tend to believe so, it would be interesting to have some empirical comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"For example, one could perhaps select some cross-domain pair, and see if T-A > T-B > T-C on such pairs, as mentioned in the author’s answer to the pre-review question.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"In general, I think this is a solid paper, and more exploration could be done in this direction.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,So I tend to accept this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,This paper presents a clear hierarchical taxonomy of transfer learning methods as applicable to sequence tagging problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,This contextualizes and unifies previous work on specific instances of this taxonomy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"Moreover, the paper shows that previously unexplored places in this taxonomy are competitive with or superior to the state of the art in key benchmark problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxpMd9lx,"It'd be nice to see this explored further, such as highlighting what is the loss as you move from the more restrictive to the less restrictive transfer learning approaches, but I believe this paper is interesting and acceptable as-is.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJTQLdqlg,This paper proposes a new memory module for large scale life-long and one-shot learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJTQLdqlg,The module is general enough that the authors apply the module to several neural network architectures and show improvements in performance.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,Major Comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,I find the paper to not be lacking in exposition and clarity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,The paper has a laundry list of related results (page 2) but no clear message.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,"I *think* one larger point is the superior performance of their retraining techniques but it is not clear how well these techniques perform compared to other retraining techniques, nor are the details of the retraining techniques clear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,"The paper requires more discussion and a clear exposition about the methods the authors introduced (i.e. RAD, IAEC).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,What follow are some more detailed comments along this theme of improving the exposition and clarity:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,The authors should provide more details about how they constructed the auto-encoder in the IAEC method (diagram?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,The same needs to be said for the RAD method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,"The authors point to a previous workshop submission (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02606) but the authors need more discussion about what this method entails and how it compares to other retraining methods (e.g. [1,2]) since this is the first peer-review of this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,Section 3.2 indicates that the authors are concerned with 'cross-model' efficiency but it is not clear from the text what this means.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,Are the author exploring the phenomenon of retraining off one algorithm and then evaluating adversarial images derived on another?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByToKu9ll,"Or, are the authors examining how examples derived from one instance of a trained model may fool or trick a second instance of a model?",0

In the experiments, the objects at the bottom level are vertices. At the next level they are radius 0 (just a vertex?) and radius 1 neighborhoods around each vertex, and the membership types here are either ""root"", or ""element"" (depending on whether a vertex is the center of the neighborhood or a neighbor). At the top level there is one object consisting of all of these neighborhoods, with membership types of ""radius 0 neighborhood"" (isn't this still just a vertex?) or ""radius 1 neighborhood"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Thus, the proposed method involves various training steps: first they train a dense network, then prune it making it sparse then train a sparse network and finally they add connections back and train the model as dense again (DSD).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The DSD method is generic method that can be used in CNN/RNN/LSTM.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"The reasons why models have better accuracy after DSD are: escape of saddle point, sparsity makes model more robust to noise and symmetry break allowing richer representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,Pro:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"The main point that this paper wants to show is that a model has the capacity to achieve higher accuracy, because it was shown that it is possible to compress a model without losing accuracy.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,And lossless compression means that there’s significant redundancy in the models that were trained using current training methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,This is an important observation that large models can get better accuracies as better training schemes are used.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,Cons & Questions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The issue is that the accuracy is slightly increased (2 or 3%) for most models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,And the question is what is the price paid for this improvement?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,Resource and performance concerns arises because training a large model is computationally expensive (hours or even days using high performance GPUs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Second question, can I keep adding Dense, Sparse and Dense training iterations to get higher and higher accuracy improvement?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,Are there limitations to this DSDSD… approach?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,This paper presents a training strategy for deep networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"First, the network is trained in a standard fashion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Second, small magnitude weights are clamped to 0; the rest of the weights continue to be trained.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Finally, all the weights are again jointly trained.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Experiments on a variety of image, text, and speech datasets demonstrate the approach can obtain high-quality results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The proposed idea is novel and interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"In a sense it is close to Dropout, though as noted in the paper the deterministic weight clamping method is different.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The main advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Three hyper-parameters are needed: the number of weights to clamp to 0, and the numbers of epochs of training used in the first dense phase and the sparse phase.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Given these, it can be plugged in to training a range of networks, as shown in the experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The concern I have is regarding the current empirical evaluation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"As noted in the question phase, it seems the baseline methods are not trained for as many epochs as the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"Standard tricks, such as dropping the learning rate upon ""convergence"" and continuing to learn, can be employed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,The response seems to indicate that these approaches can be effective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,"I think a more thorough empirical analysis of performance over epochs, learning rates, etc. would strengthen the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyoST_9xl,An exploration regarding the sparsity hyper-parameter would also be interesting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,This paper introduces a new dataset to evaluate word representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The task considered in the paper, called outlier detection (also known as word intrusion), is to identify which word does not belong to a set of semantically related words.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,The task was proposed by Camacho-Collados & Navigli (2016) as an evaluation of word representations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new dataset for this task, covering 5 languages.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,The dataset was generated automatically from the Wikidata hierarchy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"Entities which are instances of the same category are considered as belonging to the same cluster, and outliers are sampled at various distances in the tree.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,Several heuristics are then proposed to exclude uninteresting clusters from the dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,Developing good ressources to evaluate word representations is an important task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The new dataset introduced in this paper might be an interesting addition to the existing ones (however, it is hard to say by only reviewing the paper).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,I am a bit concerned by the lack of discussion and comparison with existing approaches (besides word similarity datasets).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"In particular, I believe it would be interesting to discuss the advantages of this evaluation/dataset, compared to existing ones such as word analogies.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The proposed evaluation also seems highly related to entity typing, which is not discussed in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"Overall, I believe that introducing ressources for evaluating word representations is very important for the community.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"However, I am a bit ambivalent about this submission.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,I am not entirely convinced that the proposed dataset have clear advantages over existing ressources.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"It also seems that existing tasks, such as entity typing, already capture similar properties of word representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"Finally, it might be more relevant to submit this paper to LREC than to ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,This paper describes a new benchmark for word representations: spotting the “odd one out”.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The authors build upon an idea recently presented at the RepEval workshop, but are able to collect a significantly larger amount of examples by relying on existing ontologies.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"Although the innovation is relatively incremental, it is an important step in defining challenging benchmarks for general-purpose word representations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"While humans are able to perform this task almost flawlessly (given adequate domain knowledge), the experiments in this paper show that current embeddings fall short.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"The technical contribution is thorough; the dataset construction appears logical, and the correlation analysis is convincing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,I would like to see it accepted at ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"First, let me praise the authors for generating and releasing an NLP data set: a socially useful task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,The authors use an algorithm to generate a 500-cluster-per-language data set in semantic similarity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,This brings up a few points.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"1. If the point of using the algorithm is to be scalable, why release such a small data set? It's roughly the same order of magnitude as the data sets released in the SemEval tasks over the recent years. I would have expected something orders of magnitude larger.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"2. The authors hand checked a small subset of the clusters: they found one where it was ambiguous, and should probably have been removed. Mechanical Turk can scale pretty well",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,why not post-facto filter all of the clusters using MT?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,This is (in effect),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"how ImageNet was created, and it has millions of items.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"3. Evaluating data set papers is an tricky issue. What makes a data set ""good"" or publishable? There are a number of medium-sized NLP data sets released every year (e.g., through SemEval). Those are designed to address tasks in NLP that people find interesting. I don't know of a data set that exactly addresses the task that the authors propose: the task is trying to address the idea of semantic similarity, which has had multiple data sets thrown at it since SemEval 2012. I wish that the paper had included comparisons to show that the particular task / data combination is better suited for analyzing semantic similarity than other existing data sets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,Two final notes:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,A.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,This paper doesn't seem very well-suited to ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,New NLP data sets may be indirectly useful for evaluating word embeddings (and hence representations).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"But, I didn't learn much from the paper: GloVe is empirically less good for semantic similarity than other embeddings?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkuqA_cgx,"If true, why?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,The paper shows a different approach to a ternary quantization of weights.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,1. The paper shows performance improvements over existing solutions,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,2. The idea of learning the quantization instead of using pre-defined human-made algorithm is nice and very much in the spirit of modern machine learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,1. The paper is very incremental.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"2. The paper is addressed to a very narrow audience. The paper very clearly assumes that the reader is familiar with the previous work on the ternary quantization. It is ""what is new in the topic"" update, not really a standalone paper. The description of the main algorithm is very concise, to say the least, and is probably clear to those who read some of the previous work on this narrow subject, but is unsuitable for a broader deep learning audience.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"3. There is no convincing motivation for the work. What is presented is an engineering gimmick, that would be cool and valuable if it really is used in production, but is that really needed for anything? Are there any practical applications that require this refinement? I do not find the motivation ""it is related to mobile, therefore it is cool"" sufficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"This paper is a small step further in a niche research, as long as the authors do not provide a sufficient practical motivation for pursuing this particular topic with the next step on a long list of small refinements, I do not think it belongs in ICLR with a broad and diversified audience.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Also - the code was not released is my understanding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,This paper presents new way for compressing CNN weights.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,In particular this paper uses a new neural network quantization method that compresses network weights to ternary values.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"The group has recently published multiple paper on this topic, and this one offers possibly the lowest returns I have seen.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Only a fraction of percentage in ImageNet.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"Results on AlexNet are of very little interest now, given the group already showed this kind of older style-network can be compressed by large amounts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"I also would have liked to see this group release code for the compression, and also report data on the amount of effort required to compress: flops, time, number of passes, required original dataset, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,This data is important to decide if a compression is worth the effort.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,This work presents a novel ternary weight quantization approach which quantizes weights to either 0 or one of two layer specific learned values.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"Unlike past work, these quantized values are separate and learned stochastically alongside all other network parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,This approach achieves impressive quantization results while retaining or surpassing corresponding full-precision networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Overall well written and algorithm is presented clearly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"Approach appears to work well in the experiments, resulting in good compression without loss (and sometimes gain!) of performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"I enjoyed the analysis of sparsity (and how it changes) over the course of training, though it is uncertain if any useful conclusion can be drawn from it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Some points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,The energy analysis in Table 3 assumes dense activations due to the unpredictability of sparse activations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Can the authors provide average activation sparsity for each network to help verify this assumption.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"Even if the assumption does not hold, relatively close values for average activation between the networks would make the comparison more convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"In section 5.1.1, the authors suggest having a fixed t (threshold parameter set at 0.05) for all layers allows for varying sparsity (owed to the relative magnitude of different layer weights with respect to the maximum).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"In Section 5.1.2 paragraph 2, this is further developed by suggesting additional sparsity can be achieved by allowing each layer a different values of t. How are these values set?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Does this multiple threshold style network appear in any of the tables or figures?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Can it be added?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,as a benefit of using trained quantization factors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Why is this a benefit?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Figure and table captions are not very descriptive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,Preliminary Rating:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1_pAu9xl,"In [1], the top-1 and top-5 error of AlexNet on ImageNet of BWN is 43.2% and 20.6%, which is comparable with the method proposed in this paper (42.5% and 20.3%).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,# Review,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,This paper proposes a quantitative evaluation for decoder-based generative models that use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate log-likelihoods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Quantitative evaluations are indeed much needed since for some models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), qualitative evaluation of samples is still frequently used to assess their generative capability.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Even though, there exist quantitative evaluations like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), the authors show how AIS is more accurate than KDE and how it can be used to perform fine-grained comparison between generative models (GAN, GMMs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"The authors report empirical results comparing two different decoder architectures that were both trained, on the continuous MNIST dataset, using the VAE, GAN and GMMN objectives.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"They also trained an Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) on binarized MNIST and show that, in this case, the IWAE bound underestimates the true log-likelihoods by at least 1 nat (which is significant for this dataset) according to the AIS evaluation of the same model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,# Pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Their evaluation framework is public and is definitely a nice contribution to the community.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,This paper gives some insights about how GAN behaves from log-likelihood perspective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,The authors disconfirm the commonly proposed hypothesis that GAN are memorizing training data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,The authors also observed that GANs miss important modes of the data distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,# Cons/Questions,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"It is not clear for me why sometimes the experiments were done using different number of examples (100, 1000, 10000) coming from different sources (trainset, validset, testset or simulation/generated by the model).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"For instance, in Table 2 why results were not reported using all 10,000 examples of the testing set?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"I would have like the authors to give their intuitions as to why GAN50 has a BDMC gap of 10 nats, i.e. 1 order of magnitude compared to the others?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,This paper describes how to estimate log-likelihoods of currently popular decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and HMC.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"It validates the method using bidirectional Monte Carlo on the example of MNIST, and compares the performance of GANs and VAEs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Although this seems like a fairly straight-forward application of AIS to me (correct me if I missed an important trick to make this work), I very much appreciate the educational value and empirical contributions of this paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"It should lead to clarity in debates around the density estimation performance of GANs, and should enable more people to use AIS.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Space permitting, it might be a good idea to try to expand the description of AIS.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"All the components of AIS are mentioned and a basic description of the algorithm is given, but the paper doesn’t explain well “why” the algorithm does what it does/why it works.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,I was initially confused by the widely different numbers in Figure 2.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"On first glance my expectation was that this Figure is comparing GAN, GMMN and IWAE (because of the labeling at the bottom and because of the leading words in the caption’s descriptions).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Perhaps mention in the caption that (a) and (b) use continuous MNIST and (c) uses discrete MNIST.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,“GMMN-50” should probably be “GMMN-10”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Using reconstructions for evaluation of models may be a necessary but is not sufficient condition for a good model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Depending on the likelihood, a posterior sample might have very low density under the prior, for example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,It would be great if the authors could point out and discuss the limitations of this test a bit more.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Minor:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Perhaps add a reference to MacKay’s density networks (MacKay, 1995) for decoder-based generative models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"In Section 2.2, the authors write “the prior over z can be drastically different than the true posterior p(z|x), especially in high dimension”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"I think the flow of the paper could be improved here, especially for people less familiar with importance sampling/AIS.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,I don’t think the relevance of the posterior for importance sampling is clear at this point in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,In Section 2.3 the authors claim that is often more “meaningful” to estimate p(x) in log-space because of underflow problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,“Meaningful” seems like the wrong word here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Perhaps revise to say that it’s more practical to estimate log p(x) because of underflow problems, or to say that it’s more meaningful to estimate log p(x) because of its connection to compression/surprise/entropy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"The paper describes a method to evaluate generative models such as VAE, GAN and GMMN.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,This is very much needed in our community where we still eyeball generated images to judge the quality of a model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"However, the technical increment over the NIPS 16 paper: “Measuring the reliability of MCMC inference with bidirectional Monte Carlo” is very small, or nonexistent (but please correct me if I am wrong!).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,(Grosse et al).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,The relative contribution of this paper is the application of this method to generative models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,In section 2.3 the authors seem to make a mistake.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,They write E[p’(x)] <= p(x) but I think they mean: E[log p’(x)],0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,<= log E[p’(x)],0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,= log p(x).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"Also,  for what value of x?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"If p(x) is normalized it can’t be true for all values of x. Anyways, I think there are typos here and",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,there and the equations could be more precise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,On page 5 top of the page it is said that the AIS procedure can be initialized with q(z|x) instead of p(z).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,"However, it is unclear what value of x is then picked?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Is it perhaps Ep(x)[q(z|x)] ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,I am confused with the use of the term overfitting (p8 bottom).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Does a model A overfit relative to a another model B if the test accuracy of A is higher than that of B even though the gap between train and test accuracy is also higher for B than for A. I think not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,Perhaps the last sentence on page 8 should say that VAE-50 underfits less than GMMN-50?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1M8JF9xx,The experimental results are interesting in that it exposes the fact that GANs and GMMNs seem to have much lover test accuracy than VAE despite the fact that their samples look great.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"The paper presents a novel look at binary auto-encoders, formulating the objective function as a min-max reconstruction error over a training set given the observed intermediate representations.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The author shows that this formulation leads to a bi-convex problem that can be solved by alternating minimisation methods; this part is non-trivial and is the main contribution of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"Proof-of-concept experiments are performed, showing improvements for 1-hidden layer auto-encoders with respect to a vanilla approach.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"The experimental section is fairly weak because the literature on auto-encoders is huge and many variants were shown to perform better than straightforward approaches without being more complicated (e.g., denoising auto-encoders).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"Yet, the paper presents an analysis that leads to a new learning algorithm for an old problem, and is likely worth discussing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The author attacks the problem of shallow binary autoencoders using a minmax game approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"The algorithm, though simple, appears to be very effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The paper is well written and has sound analyses.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"Although the work does not extend to deep networks immediately, its connections with other popular minmax approaches (eg GANs) could be fruitful in the future.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The paper propose to find an optimal decoder for binary data using a min-max decoder on the binary hypercube given a linear constraint on the correlation between the encoder and the  data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The paper gives finally that the optimal decoder as logistic of the lagragian W multiplying the encoding e.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"Given the weights of the ‘min-max’decoder W the paper finds the best encoding for the data distribution considered, by minimizing that error as a function of the encoding.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"The paper then alternates that optimization between the encoding and the min-max decoding, starting from random weights W.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,clarity:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The paper would be easier to follow if the real data (x in section 3 ) is differentiated from the worst case data played by the model (x in section 2).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,significance,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"Overall I like the paper, however I have some doubts on what the alternating optimization optimum ends up being.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,The paper ends up implementing a single layer network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,"The correlation constraints while convenient in the derivation, is  a bit intriguing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,Since linear relation between the encoding and the data  seems to be weak modeling constraint and might be not different from what PCA would implement.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,what is the performance of PCA on those tasks?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,one could you use a simple sign function to decode.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,This is related to one bit compressive sensing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,what happens if you initialize W in algorithm one with PCA weights?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,or weighted pca weights?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryelgY5eg,Have you tried on more complex datasets such as cifar?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,I think the paper is a bit more solid now,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,and I still stand by my positive review.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,I do however agree with other reviewers that the tasks are very simple.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"While NPI is trained with stronger supervision, it is able to learn quicksort perfectly as shown by Dawn Song and colleagues in this conference.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,Reed et al had already demonstrated it for bubblesort.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"If the programs are much shorter, it becomes easy to marginalise over latent variables (pointers) and solve the task end to end.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"The failure to attack much longer combinatorial problems is my main complaint about this paper, because it makes one feel that it is over-claiming.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"In relation to the comments concerning NPI,  Reed et al freeze the weights of the core LSTM to then show that an LSTM with fixed weights can continue learning new programs that re-use the existing programs (ie the trained model can create new programs).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"However, despite this criticism, I still think this is an excellent paper, illustrating the power of combining traditional programming with neural networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,It is very promising and I would love to see it appear at ICLR.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,===========,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,This paper makes a valuable contribution to the emerging research area of learning programs from data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"The authors mix their TerpreT framework, which enables them to compile programs with finite integer variables to a (differentiable) TensorFlow graph,  and neural networks for perceiving simple images.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,This is made possible through the use of simple tapes and arithmetic tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"In these arithmetic tasks, two networks are re-used, one for digits and one for arithmetic operations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"This clean setup enables the authors to demonstrate not only the avoidance of catastrophic interference, but in fact some reverse transfer.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"Overall, this is a very elegant and potentially very useful way to combine symbolic programming with neural networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"As a full-fledged tool, it could become very useful.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,Thus far it has only been demonstrated on very simple examples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"It would be nice for instance to see it demonstrated in all the tasks introduced in other approaches to neural programming and induction: sorting, image manipulation, semantic parsing, question answering.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"Hopefully, the authors will release neural TerpreT to further advance research in this domain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,This paper proposes an extension of TerpreT by adding a set of functions that can deal with inputs in the form of tensor with continuous values.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,This potentially allows TerpreT to learn programs over images or other “natural” sources.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,TerpreT generates a source code from a set of input/output examples.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,The code is generate in the form of a TensorFlow computation graph based on a set of simple and elegant program representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"One of the limitation of TerpreT is the type of inputs it can work with, this work aim at enriching it by adding “learnable functions” that can deal with more complex input variables.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"While I really like this direction of research and the development of TerpreT, I find the contribution of this work to be a bit limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"This would have been fine if it was supported by a strong and convincing experimental section, but unfortunately, the experimental section is a bit weak: the tasks studied are relatively simple and the baselines are not very strong.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"For example let us consider the SUM2x2 problem:  all the images of digits are from MNIST, which can be classify with an error of 8% with a linear model (and even better with neural networks), There is also a linear model that given 4 numbers will compute the 2x2sum of them that is: y=Ax where x is the vector containing the 4 numbers and A =",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,[1 0 1 0;1 1 0 0;1 0 0 1; 0 1 0 1].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,This means a succession of two linear models can solve the sum2x2 problems with little trouble.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"While I'm aware that this work aims at automatically finding the combination of simple models to achieve this task end-to-end, the fact that the solution is a set of 2 consecutive linear models makes it a bit too simple in my humble opinion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"Overall, I think that this paper proposes a promising extension of TerpreT that is unfortunately not backed by experiments that are convincing enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,The authors explore the idea of life-long learning in the context of program generation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,The main weakness of this paper is that it mixes a few issues without showing strong results on any of them.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"The test tasks are about program generation, but these are toy tasks even by the low standards of deep-learning for program generation (except for the MATH task, they are limited to 2x2 grid).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"Even on MATH, the authors train and discuss generalization from 2-digit expressions",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"these are very short, so the conclusiveness of the experiment is unclear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,The main point of the paper is supposed to be transfer learning though.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"Unluckily, the authors do not compare to other transfer learning models (e.g., ""Progressive Neural Networks"") nor do they test on tasks that were previously used by others.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,We find that only testing on a newly-created task with a weak baseline is not sufficient for ICLR acceptance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"After clarifying comments from the authors and more experiments (see the discussion above), I'm now convinced that the authors mostly measure overfitting, which in their model is prevented because the model is hand-fitted to the task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,"While the idea might still be valid and interesting, many harder and much more diverse experiments are needed to verify it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJStZKqel,I consider this paper a clear rejection at present.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,This work presents an LSTM based meta-learning framework to learn the optimization algorithm of a another learning algorithm (here a NN).,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,This is a strong paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,My only concerns/questions are the following:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,"1. Can it be redundant to use the loss, gradient and parameters as input to the meta-learner? Did you do ablative studies to make sure simpler combinations are not enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,"2. It would be great if other architectural components of the network can be learned in a similar fashion (number of neurons, type of units, etc.). Do you have an opinion about this?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY0-Kcll,3. The related work section (mainly focused on meta learning) is a bit shallow. Meta-learning is a rather old topic and similar approaches have been tried to solve the same problem even if they were not using LSTMs:,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,===============,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,1. Claims about the contribution/novelty of the model seem not to hold:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,1.1. One of the main contributions is the Hierarchical Attention/Memory (HAM):,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"1.1.1. It is not clear to me how the presented model (Eq 6-8), are significantly different from the presented model in Xu et al / Yao et al. While Xu et al. attends over spatial image locations and Yao et al. attend over frames, this model attends over encoded video representations h_v^i. A slight difference might be that Xu et al. use the same LSTM to generate, while this model uses an additional LSTM for the decoding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"1.1.2. The paper states in section 3.2 “we propose f_m to memorize the previous attention”, however H_m^{t’-1} only consist of the last hidden state. Furthermore, the model f_m does not have access to the “attention” \alpha. This was also discussed in comments by others, but remains unclear.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"1.1.3. In the discussion of comments the authors claim that “attention not only is a function a current time step but also a function of all previous attentions and network states.”: While it is true that there is a dependency but that is true also for any LSTM, however the model does not have access to the previous network states as H_g^{t’-1} only consist of the last hidden state, as well as H_m^{t’-1} [at least that is what the formulas say and what Figure 1 suggests].",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"1.1.4. The authors claim to have multi-layer attention in HAM, however it remains unclear where the multi-layer comes from.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"1.2. The paper states that in section 3.1. “[CNN] features tend to discard the low level information useful in modeling the motion in the video (Ballas et al., 2016).” This suggests that the approach which follows attacks this problem. However, it cannot model motion as attention \rho between frames is not available when predicting the next frame. Also, it is not clear how the model can capture anything “low level” as it operates on rather high level VGG conv 5 features.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,2. Related work: The difference of HAM to Yao et al. and Xu et al. should be made more clear / or these papers should be cited in the HAM section.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"3. Conceptual Limitation of the model: The model has two independent attention mechanisms, a spatial one, and a temporal one. The spatial (within a frame) is independent of the sentence generation. It thus cannot attend to different aspects of the frames for different words which would make sense. E.g. if the sentence is “the dog jumps on the trampoline”, the model should focus on the dog when saying “dog” and on the trampoline when saying “trampoline”, however, as the spatial attention is fixed this is difficult. Also, the encoder model does not have an explicitly way to look at different aspects in the frame during the encoding so might likely get stuck and always predict the same spatial attention for all frames (or it might e.g. always attend to the dog which moves around, but never on the scene).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"4. Eq 11 contradicts Fig 1: How is the model exactly receiving the previous word as input. Eq. 11 suggests it is the softmax. If this is the case, the authors should emphasize this in the text as this is unusual. More common would be to use the ground truth previous word during training (which Fig 11 suggests) and the “hardmax”, i.e. the highest predicted previous word encoded as one-hot vector at test time.",0

If space is a problem, e.g. the well-known equations for LSTM, softmax (Eq 2), and log likelihood loss (Eq 12) could be omitted or inlined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,6. Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,6.1. The paper claims that the “the proposed architecture outperforms all previously proposed methods and leads to a new state of the art results”.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"6.1.1. For the MSVD dataset this clearly is wrong, even given the same feature representation. Pan et al. (2016 a) in Table 2 achieve higher METEOR (33.10).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"6.1.2. For this strong claim, I would also expect that it outperforms all previous results independent of the features used, which is also wrong again, Yu et al achieve higher performance in all compared metrics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"6.1.3. For Charades dataset, this claim is also too bold as hardly any methods have been evaluated on this dataset, so at least all the ablations reported in Table 1 should also be reported for the Charades dataset, to make for this dataset any stronger claims.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"6.4. Missing human evaluation: I disagree with the authors that a human evaluation is not feasible. 1. An evaluation on a subset of the test data is not so difficult. 2. Even if other authors do not provide their code/model [and some do], they are typically happy to share the predicted sentences which is sufficient and even better for human evaluation [if not I would explicitly mention that some authors did not share sentences, as this seems clearly wrong]. 3. For model ablations the sentences are available to the authors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,7. Several of the comments raised by reviewers/others have not yet been incorporated in a revised version of the paper and/or are still not clear from the explanations given. E.g. including SPICE evaluation and making fixes seems trivial.,0

The decoder of Section 3.3 is a standard LSTM with log likelihood. The HAM module of Section 3.2 is the novel module but is not very well described. It looks to be an attention LSTM where the attention is over the TEM LSTM outputs, but the attention weights are additionally conditioned on the decoder state. There are a lot of small problems with the description, such as notational discrepancy in using \textbf in equations and then not using it in the text.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkJeEtclx,"2. Experimental results: The ablation study shows mixed results when adding TEM and HAM to the model. Looking at METEOR which was shown to have the highest correlation to humans in the COCO paper compared to the other evaluation criteria, adding TEM+HAM improves the model from 31.20 to 31.70. It is not clear how significant this improvement is, especially given that the test set is only 670 videos. I have doubts over this result. In Table 2, the METEOR score of Pan et al. 2016a is higher [33.10 vs. 31.80], but this discrepancy is not addressed in text. This is surprising because the authors explicitly claim ""state of the art results"".",0

Originality/Significance: The paper introduces an additional layer of attention over a more standard sequence to sequence setup, which is argued to alleviate the burden on the LSTM's memory.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BybtVK9lg,A more convincing experimental design is to explore the effect of each trick separately in neural variational inference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,The method proposes to compress the weight matrices of deep networks using a new density-diversity penalty together with a computing trick (sorting weights) to make computation affordable and a strategy of tying weights.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,This approach results in sparse weight matrices comprised of relatively few unique values.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,"Despite introducing a more efficient means of computing the gradient with respect to the diversity penalty, the authors still find it necessary to apply the penalty with some low probability (1-5%) per mini-batch.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,The approach achieves impressive compression of fully connected layers with relatively little loss of accuracy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,I wonder if the cost of having to sort weights (even for only 1 or 2 out of 100 mini-batches) might make this method intractable for larger networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,Perhaps the sparsity could help remove some of this cost?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,I think the biggest fault this paper has is the number of different things going on in the approach that are not well explored independently.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,"Sparse initialization, weight tying, probabilistic application of density-diversity penalty and setting the mode to 0, and alternating schedule between weight tied standard training and diversity penalty training.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,"Furthermore, the only quantitative metric shown is the compression rate which is a function of both sparsity and diversity such that they cannot be compared on their own.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,"I would really like to see how each component of the algorithm affects diversity, sparsity, and overall compression.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,A quick verification: Section 3.1 claims the density-diversity penalty is applied with a fixed probability per batch while 3.4 implies structured phases alternating between application of density-diversity and weight tied standard cross entropy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,Is this scheme in 3.4 only applying the density-diversity penalty probabilistically when it is in the density-diversity phase?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hku9NK5lx,Preliminary rating:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1VyHY9gg,My main issue with the evaluation in this paper is that there is no comparison between the noising/smoothing idea and more conventional regularizers (such as L2 and dropout) which were discussed in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1VyHY9gg,"Likewise, it would have been interesting if the techniques proposed here had been applied to stronger base models (such as the models compared with in Table 2).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,This papers adds to the literature on learning optimizers/algorithms that has gained popularity recently.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,The authors choose to use the framework of guided policy search at the meta-level to train the optimizers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,They also opt to train on random objectives and assess transfer to a few simple tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"As pointed below, this is a useful addition.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"However, the argument of using RL vs gradients at the meta-level that appears below is not clear or convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,I urge the authors to run an experiment comparing the two approaches and to present comparative results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"This is a very important question, and the scalability of this approach could very well hinge on this fact.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"Indeed, demonstrating both scaling to large domains and transfer to those domains is the key challenge in this domain.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"In summary, the idea is a good one, but the experiments are weak.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,The current version of the paper is improved w.r.t.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,the original arXiv version from June.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"While the results are exactly the same, the text does not oversell them as much as before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"You may also consider to avoid words like ""mantra"", etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"I believe that my criticism given in my comment from 3 Dec 2016 about ""randomly generated task"" is valid and you answer is not.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,This paper proposes an approach to learning a custom optimizer for a given class optimization problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"I think in the case of training machine learning algorithms, a class would represent a model like “logistic regression”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,The authors cleverly cast this as a reinforcement learning problem and use guided policy search to train a neural network to map the current location and history onto a step direction/magnitude.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Overall I think this is a great idea and a very nice contribution to the fast growing meta-learning literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"However, I think that there are some aspects that could be touched on to make this a stronger paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"My first thought is that the authors claim to train the method to learn the regularities of an entire class of optimization problems, rather than learning to exploit regularities in a given set of tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,The distinction here is not terribly clear to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"For example, in learning an optimizer for logistic regression, the authors seem to claim that learning on a randomly sampled set of logistic regression problems will allow the model to learn about logistic regression itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"I am not convinced of this, because there is bias in the randomly sampled data itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"From the paper in this case, “The instances are drawn randomly from two multivariate Gaussians with random means and covariances, with half drawn from each.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,It seems the optimizer is then trained to optimize instances of logistic regression *given this specific family of training inputs* and not logistic regression problems in general.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"A simple experiment to prove the method works more generally would be to repeat the existing experiments, but where the test instances are drawn from a completely different distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,It would be even more interesting to see how this changes as the test distribution deviates further from the training distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Can the authors comment on the choice of architecture used here?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Why one layer with 50 hidden units and softplus activations specifically?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"Why not e.g., 100 units, 2 layers and ReLUs?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"Presumably this is to prevent overfitting, but given the limited capacity of the network, how do these results look when the dimensionality of the input space increases beyond 2 or 3?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"I would love to see what kind of policy the network learns on e.g., a 2D function using a contour plot.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,What do the steps look like on a random problem instance when compared to other hand-engineered optimizers?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Overall I think this a really interesting paper with a great methodological contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,My main concern is that the results may be oversold as the problems are still relatively simple and constrained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"However, if the authors can demonstrate that this approach produces robust policies for a very general set of problems then that would be truly spectacular.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Minor notes below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Section 3.1 should you be using \pi_T^* to denote the optimal policy?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,You use \pi_t^* and \pi^* currently.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,Are the problems here considered noiseless?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,"That is, is the state transition given an action deterministic?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry4Vrt5gl,It would be very interesting to see this on noisy problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,This paper addresses automated argumentation mining using pointer network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"Although the task and the discussion is interesting, the contribution and the novelty is marginal because this is a single-task application of PN among many potential tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"This paper addresses the problem of argument mining, which consists of finding argument types and predicting the relationships between the arguments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,The authors proposed a pointer network structure to recover the argument relations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,They also propose modifications on pointer network to perform joint training on both type and link prediction tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"Overall the model is reasonable, but I am not sure if ICLR is the best venue for this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,My first concern of the paper is on the novelty of the model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,Pointer network has been proposed before.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"The proposed multi-task learning method is interesting, but the authors only verified it on one task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,This makes me feel that maybe the submission is more for a NLP conference rather than ICLR.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,The authors stated that the pointer network is less restrictive compared to some of the existing tree predicting method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"However, the datasets seem to only contain single trees or forests, and the stack-based method can be used for forest prediction by adding a virtual root node to each example (as done in the dependency parsing tasks).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"Therefore, I think the experiments right now cannot reflect the advantages of pointer network models unfortunately.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,My second concern of the paper is on the target task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"Given that the authors want to analyze the structures between sentences, is the argumentation mining the best dataset?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"For example, authors could verify their model by applying it to the other tasks that require tree structures such as dependency parsing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"As for NLP applications, I found that the assumption that the boundaries of AC are given is a very strong constraint, and could potentially limit the usefulness of the proposed model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"Overall, in terms of ML, I also feel that baseline methods the authors compared to are probably strong for the argument mining task, but not necessary strong enough for the general tree/forest prediction tasks (as there are other tree/forest prediction methods).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"In terms of NLP applications, I think the assumption of having AC boundaries is too restrictive, and maybe ICLR is not the best venture for this submission.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,This paper proposes a model for the task of argumentation mining (labeling the set of relationships between statements expressed as sentence-sized spans in a short text).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,The model combines a pointer network component that identifies links between statements and a classifier that predicts the roles of these statements.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"The resulting model works well: It outperforms strong baselines, even on datasets with fewer than 100 training examples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"I don't see any major technical issues with this paper, and the results are strong.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"I am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,It focuses on ways to adapt reasonably mature techniques to a novel NLP problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,I think that one of the ACL conferences would be a better fit for this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"The choice of a pointer network for this problem seems reasonable, though (as noted by other commenters)",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,the paper does not make any substantial comparison with other possible ways of producing trees.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"The paper does a solid job at breaking down the results quantitatively, but I would appreciate some examples of model output and some qualitative error analysis.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,Detail notes:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,Figure 2 appears to have an error.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1KBHtcel,"You report that the decoder produces a distribution over input indices only, but you show an example of the network pointing to an output index in one case.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"Under my point of view, the robustness of a classifier against adversarial noise it is interesting if we find any relationship between that robustness and generalization to new unseen test samples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,I guess that this relationship is direct in most of the problems but perhaps classifier C1 could be more robust than C2 against adv.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,noise but not better for new unseen samples from the task in consideration.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"Best results on new unseen samples are normally related to robustness against the common distortions of the data, e.g. invariance to scale, rotation… than robustness to adv. noise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,I can not see any direct conclusion from table 5 results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Essentially i am not convinced about the necessity to measure the robustness against adversarial noise.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This paper aims at making three contributions:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Charecterizing robustness to adversarials in a topological manner.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Connecting the topological characterization to more quantitative measurements and evaluating deep networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Using Siamese network training to create models robust to adversarial in a practical manner and evaluate their properties.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"In my opinion the paper would improve greatly if the first, topological analysis attempt would be removed from the paper altogether.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,A central notion of the paper is the abstract characterization of robustness.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"The main weakness is the notion of strong robustness itself, which is an extremely rigid notion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,It requires the partitioning of the predictor function by class to match the exact partitioning of the oracle.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This robustness is almost never the case in real life: it requires that the predictor is almost perfect.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,The main flaw however is that the output space is assumed to have discrete topology and continuity is assumed for the classifier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Continuity of the classifier wrt.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,a discrete output is also never really satisfied.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"However, if the output space is assumed to be continues values with an interesting topology (like probabilities), then the notion of strong robustness becomes so constrained and strict, that it has even less practical sense and relevance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"Based on those definition, several uninteresting, trivial consequences follow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"They seem to be true, with inelegant proofs, but that matters little as they seem irrelevant for any practical purposes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,The second part is a well executed experiment by training a Siamese architecture with an explicit additional robustness constraint.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"The approach seems to be working very well, but is compared only to a baseline (stability training) which performs worse than the original model without any trainings for adversarials.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This is strange as adversarial examples have been studied extensively in the past year and several methods claimed improvements over the original model not trained for robustness.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"The experimental section and approach would look interesting, if it were compared with a stronger baseline, however the empty theoretical definitions and analysis attempts make the paper in its current form unappealing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This paper theoretically analyzes the adversarial phenomenon by modeling the topological relationship between the feature space of the trained and the oracle discriminate function.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"In particular, the (complicated) discriminant function (f) is decomposed into a feature extractor (g) and a classifier (c), where the feature extractor (g) defines the feature space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"The main contribution of this paper is to propose abstract understanding and analysis for adversarial phenomenon, which is interesting and important.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"However, this paper also has the following problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,1) It is not clear how the classifier c can affect the overall robustness to adversarial noises.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"The classifier c seems absent from the analysis, which somehow indicates that the classifier does not matter.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,(Please correct me if it is not true),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This is counter-intuitive.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"For example, if we always take the input space as the feature space and the entire f as the classifier c, the strong robustness can always hold.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,I am also wondering if the metric d has anything to do with the classifier c.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,2) A very relevant problem is how to decompose f into g and c.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"For examples, one can take any intermediate layer or the input space as the feature space for a neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Will this affect the analysis of the adversarial robustness?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,3),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,The oracle is a good concept.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"However, it is hard to explicitly define it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"In this paper, the feature space of the oracle is just the input image space, and the inf-norm is used as the metric.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This implementation makes the algorithm in Section 4 quite similar to existing methods (though there are some detailed differences as mentioned in the discussion).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"Due to the above problems, I feel that some aspects of the paper are not ready.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"If the problems are resolved or better clarified, I believe a higher rating can be assigned to this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"In addition, the main text of this paper is somehow too long, the arguments can be more focused if the main paper become more concise.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Some critiques:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,It might be nicer to think more about the detailed mechanics of human vision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"In the early state of primary visual cortex, feature space might be linear, L2 norm might be sufficient to capture the key difference between DNN and human metrics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,"However, when the information flow goes deep, single one metric might not be sufficient when the Oracle feature space is highly curved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Tracking and reducing the metric distance in cognitive level would be extremely hard.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,This paper offers a pioneering advance to tackle this problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywUHFcge,Hope more work can be done to further our understanding towards the limitation of DNN.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbPBt9lg,This paper considers the code completion problem: given partially written source code produce a distribution over the next token or sequence of tokens.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbPBt9lg,This is an interesting and important problem with relevance to industry and research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJbPBt9lg,The authors propose an LSTM model that sequentially generates a depth-first traversal over an AST.,1

However, a PHOG and OOPSLA’16 predictions considers not only these 44 types, but also whether there are right siblings and children of a node.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"The authors propose a multi-hop ""gated attention"" model, which models the interactions between query and document representations, for answering cloze-style questions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The document representation is attended to sequentially over multiple-hops using similarity with the query representation (using a dot-product) as the scoring/attention function.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"The proposed method improves upon (CNN, Daily Mail, Who-Did-What datasets) or is comparable to (CBT dataset) the state-of-the-art results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,1. Nice idea on heirarchical attention for modulating the context (document) representation by the task-specific (query) representation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,2. The presentation is clear with thorough experimental comparison with the latest results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"1. The overall system presents a number of architectural elements: (1) attention at multiple layers (multi-hop), (2) query based attention for the context (or gated attention), (3) encoding the query vector at each layer independently.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,It is important to breakdown the gain in performance due to the above factors: the ablation study presented in section 4.4 helps establish the importance of Gated Attention (#2 above).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"However, it is not clear:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,(1) how much multiple-hops of gated-attention contribute to the performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,(2) how important is it to have a specialized query encoder for each layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"Understanding the above better, will help simplify the architecture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,2. The tokens are represented using L(w) and C(w). It is not clear if C(w) is crucial for the performance of the proposed method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"There is a significant performance drop when C(w) is absent (e.g. in ""GA Reader",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"""; although there are other changes in ""GA Reader",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,""" which could affect the performance).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"Hence, it is not clear how much does the main idea, i.e., gated attention contributes towards the superior performance of the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,This paper presents an interesting idea for iteratively re-weighting the word representations in a document (hence the GRU-coded doc representation as well) with a simple multiplication operation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"As the authors correctly pointed out, such an operation serves as a ""filter"" to reduce the attentions to less relevant parts in the document, hence leading to better performance of the modeling.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The results are or close to the state-of-the-art for a few Cloze-style QA tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"This paper would deserve an even higher score, if the following limitations could be addressed better:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"1. While interesting and conceptually simple (though with significant increased computational overheads), the architecture proposed in the paper is for a very specific task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"2. The improvement of the main idea of this paper (gated attention) is less significant, comparing GA Reader",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"vs. GA Reader, while the latter includes a number of engineering tricks such as adding character embedding and using a word embedding trained from larger corpus (GloVe), as well as some small improvements on the modeling by using token-specific attention in (5).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"3. I also wish the authors can shed more lights on what a role the K (number of hops) plays, both intuitively and empirically. I feel more insights could be obtained if we do more deeper analysis of K's impacts to different types of questions for example.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,SUMMARY.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The paper proposes a machine reading approach for cloze-style question answering.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The proposed system first encodes the query and the document using a bidirectional gru.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,These two representations are combined together using a Gated Attention (GA).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,GA calculates the compatibility of each word in the document and the query as a probability distribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,For each word in the document a gate is calculated weighting the query representation according to the word compatibility.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"Ultimately, the gate is applied to the gru-encoded document word.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The resulting word vectors are re-encoded with a bidirectional GRU.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,This process is performed for multiple hops.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"After k hops, the probability of a word to be part of the answer is calculated by a log-linear model that take as input the last word representations, and the concatenation of the last query representation before and after the cloze token.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The probability of a candidate being the answer to the question is given by a linear combination of the single word probabilities.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The proposed model is tested on 4 different dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The authors shown that the proposed model works well (state-of-the-art performance) for 3 out of 4 benchmarks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,OVERALL JUDGMENT,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"The main contribution of the paper is the gated attention mechanism, that in my opinion, is a simple and interesting idea.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"The paper is well thought, and the ablation study on the benefits given by the gated attention are convincing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,The GA reader as whole model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on 3 benchmarks and seems very promising also on the CBT dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"I would have liked to see some discussion on why the model works less well on the CBT dataset, though.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,DETAILED COMMENTS,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkcdHtqlx,"minor. In the introduction, Weston et al., 2014 do not use any attention mechanism.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The paper addresses the problem of predicting learning curves.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The key difference from prior work is that (1) the authors learn a neural network that generalizes across hyperparameter settings and (2) the authors use a Bayesian neural network with SGHMC.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"The authors demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective on extrapolating partially observed curves as well as predicting unobserved learning curves on various architectures (FC, CNN, LR and VAE).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"This seems very promising for Bayesian optimization, I'd love to see an experiment that evaluates the relative advantage of this proposed method :)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Have you thought about ways to handle learning rate decays?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Perhaps you could run the algorithm on a random subset of data and extrapolate from that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,I was thinking of other evaluation measures in addition to MSE and LL.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"In practice, we care about the most promising run.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Would it make sense to evaluate how accurately each method identified the best run?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Fonts are too small and almost illegible on my hard copy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Please increase the font size for legends and axes in the figures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Fig 6: not all figures seem to have six lines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Are the lines overlapping in some cases?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This paper is about using Bayesian neural networks to model learning curves (that arise from training ML algorithms).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"The application is hyper-parameter optimization: if we can model the learning curve, we can terminate bad runs early and save time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The paper builds on existing work that used parametric learning curves.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Here, the parameters of these learning curves form the last layer of a Bayesian neural network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This seems like a totally sensible idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,I think the main strength of this paper is that it addresses an actual need.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Based on my personal experience, there is high demand for a working system to do early termination in hyperparameter optimization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"What I'd like to know, which I wish I'd asked during pre-review questions, is whether the authors plan to release their code.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Do you?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"I sincerely hope so, because I think the code would be a significant part of the paper's contribution, since the nature of the paper is more practical than conceptual.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The experiments in the paper seem thorough but the results are a bit underwhelming.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"I'm less interested in the part about whether the learning curves are actually modeled well, and more interested in the impact on hyperparameter optimization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"I was hoping to see BIG speedups as a result of using this method, but I am left feeling unsure how big the speedup really is.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Instead of ""objective function vs. iterations"" I would be more interested in the inverse plot: number of iterations needed to get to a fixed objective function value.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Since what I'm really interested in is how much time I can save.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Ideally there would also be some mention of real time as sometimes these hyperparameter optimization methods are themselves so slow that they end up being unusable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Finally, one figure that I feel is missing is a histogram of termination times over different runs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This would provide me with more intuition than all the other figures.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Because it would tell me, what fraction of runs are being terminated early.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"And, how early?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Right now I have no sense of this, except that at least *some* runs are clearly being terminated early, since this is neccessary for the proposed method to outperform other methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Overall, I think this paper merits acceptance because it is a solid effort on an interesting problem.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The progress is fairly incremental but I can live with that.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This paper proposes a new Bayesian neural network architecture for predicting the values of learning curves during the training of machine learning models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"This is an exploratory paper, in that the ultimate goal is to use this method in a Bayesian optimization system, but for now the experiments are limited to assessing the quality of the predictions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"This builds on previous work in Domhan, 2015, however in this work the model incorporates information from all tested hyperparameter settings rather than just extrapolating from a single learning curve.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"This paper also explores two MCMC methods for inference: SGLD and SGHMC, but I couldn’t tell if either of these were tested in Domhan, 2015 as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"The performance seems overall positive, particularly in the initial phase of each curve where there is very little information.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"In this case, as expected, sharing knowledge across curves helps.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"One regime which did not seem to be tested, but might be very informative, is when some curves in the training set have been mostly, or fully observed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This might be a case where sharing information really helps.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Something that concerns me about this approach is the timing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,The authors stated that to train the network takes about 20-60 seconds.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"In the worst case, with 100 epochs, this results in a little over 1.5 hours spent training the Bayesian network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,This is a non-trivial fraction of the several hours it takes to train the model being tuned.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"The Bayesian network makes many separate predictions, as shown in Figure 2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,It would be interesting to see how accurate some of these individual pieces are.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"For example, did you bound the asymptotic value of the learning curve, since you mostly predicted accuracy?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"If not, did the value tend to lie in [0,1]?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Below are some minor questions/comments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Figure 1 axes should read “validation accuracy”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Figure 6 can you describe LastSeenValue (although it seems self-explanatory, it’s good to be explicit) in the bottom left figure, and why isn’t it used anywhere else as a baseline?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Figure 7 and Table 1 are you predicting just the final value of the curves?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,"Or every value along each curve, conditioned on the previous values?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Why do you only use 5 basis functions?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Does this sufficiently capture all of the flexibility of these learning curves?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S11KBYclx,Would more basis functions help or hurt?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,It would seem that the shelf life of a dataset has decreased rapidly in recent literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"SQuAD dataset has been heavily pursued as soon as it hit online couple months ago, the best performance on their leaderboard now reaching to 82%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"This is rather surprising when taking into account the fact that the formal conference presentation of the dataset took place only a month ago at EMNLP’16, and that the reported machine performance (at the time of paper submission) was only at 51%.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,One reasonable speculation is that the dataset may have not been hard enough.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"NewsQA, the paper in submission, aims to address this concern by presenting a dataset of a comparable scale created through different QA collection strategies.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Most notably, the authors solicit questions without requiring answers from the same turkers, in order to promote more diverse and hard-to-answer questions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Another notable difference is that the questions are gathered without showing the content of the news articles, and the dataset makes use of a bigger subset of CNN/Daily corpus (12K / 90K), as opposed to a much smaller subset (500 / 90K) used by SQuAD.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"In sum, I think NewsQA dataset presents an effort to construct a harder, large-scale reading comprehension challenge, a recently hot research topic for which we don’t yet have satisfying datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"While not without its own weaknesses, I think this dataset presents potential values compared to what are available out there today.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"That said, the paper does read like it was prepared in a hurry, as there are numerous small things that the authors could have done better.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"As a result, I do wonder about the quality of the dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"For one, human performance of SQuAD measured by the authors (70.5 - 82%) is lower than that reported by SQuAD (80.3 - 90.5%).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,I think this sort of difference can easily happen depending on the level of carefulness the annotators can maintain.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"After all, not all humans have the same level of carefulness or even the same level of reading comprehension.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"I think it’d be the best if the authors can try to explain the reason behind these differences, and if possible, perform a more careful measurement of human performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"If anything, I don’t think it looks favorable for NewsQA if the human performance is only at the level of 74.9%, as it looks as if the difficulty of the dataset comes mainly from the potential noise from the QA collection process, which implies that the low model performance could result from not necessarily because of the difficulty of the comprehension and reasoning, but because of incorrect answers given by human annotators.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,I’m also not sure whether the design choice of not presenting the news article when soliciting the questions was a good one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,I can imagine that people might end up asking similar generic questions when not enough context has been presented.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Perhaps taking a hybrid, what I would like to suggest is to present news articles where some sentences or phrases are randomly redacted, so that the question generators can have a bit more context while not having the full material in front of them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Yet another way of encouraging the turkers from asking too trivial questions is to engage an automatic QA system on the fly — turkers must construct a QA pair for which an existing state-of-the-art system cannot answer correctly.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"This paper presents a new comprehension dataset called NewsQA dataset, containing 100,000 question-answer pairs from over 10,000 news articles from CNN.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,The dataset is collected through a four-stage process,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"article filtering, question collection, answer collection and answer validation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Examples from the dataset are divided into different types based on answer types and reasoning required to answer questions.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Paper Strengths:,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,The proposed dataset is sufficiently large for data hungry deep learning models to train.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,The inclusion of questions with null answers is a nice property to have.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Human evaluation is weak.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Two near-native English speakers' performance on 100 examples each can hardly be a representative of the complete dataset.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Not that it is necessary for this paper, but to clearly demonstrate that this dataset is harder than SQuAD, the authors should either calculate the human performance the same way as SQuAD or calculate human performances on both NewsQA and SQuAD in some other consistent manner on large enough subsets which are good representatives of the complete datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Dataset from other communities such as VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) also use the same method as SQuAD to compute human performance.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Preliminary Evaluation:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"The proposed dataset is a large scale machine comprehension dataset collected from news articles, which in my suggestion, is diverse enough from existing datasets that state-of-the-art models can definitely benefit from it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"With a better human evaluation, I think this paper will make a good poster.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Summary: The paper proposes a novel machine comprehension dataset called NEWSQA. The dataset consists of over 100,000 question answer pairs based on over 10,000 news articles from CNN. The paper analyzes the different types of answers and the different types of reasoning required to answer questions in the dataset. The paper evaluates human performance and the performance of two baselines on the dataset and compares them with the performance on SQuAD dataset.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,1. The paper presents a large scale dataset for machine comprehension.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,2. The question collection method seems reasonable to collect exploratory questions. Having an answer validation step is desirable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,3. The paper proposes a novel (computationally more efficient) implementation of the match-LSTM model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,Weaknesses:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"1. The human evaluation presented in the paper is not satisfactory because the human performance is reported on a very small subset (200 questions). So, it seems unlikely that these 200 questions will provide a reliable measure of the human performance on the entire dataset (which consists of thousands of questions).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"2. NEWSQA dataset is very similar to SQuAD dataset in terms of the size of the dataset, the type of dataset",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"natural language questions posed by crowdworkers, answers comprising of spans of text from related paragraphs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,The paper presents two empirical ways to show that NEWSQA is more challenging than SQuAD,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,1) the gap between human and machine performance in NEWSQA is larger than that in SQuAD.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"However, since the human performance numbers are reported on very small subset, these trends might not carry over when human performance is computed on all of the dataset.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,2) the sentence-level accuracy on SQuAD is higher than that in NEWSQA.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"However, as the paper mentions, the differences in accuracies could likely be due to different lengths of documents in the two datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"So, even this measure does not truly reflect that SQuAD is less challenging than NEWSQA.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"So, it is not clear if NEWSQA is truly more challenging than SQuAD.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"3. Authors mention that BARB is computationally more efficient and faster compared to match-LSTM. However, the paper does not report how much faster BARB is compared to match-LSTM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"4. On page 7, under ""Boundary pointing"" paragraph, the paper should clarify what ""s"" in ""n_s"" refers to.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry3iBFqgl,"Review summary: While the dataset collection method seems interesting and promising, I would be more convinced after I see the following",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,The extensive tests done on the datasets is probably the greatest asset of this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Negatives,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,The paper could use some double checking for typos.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,The Section A.2.3 really belongs in the main article as it deals with important related works.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Swap it with the imprecise diagrams of the model if you need space.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,No mention of any methods from the statistics litterature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Here are the two main points of this review that informs my decision:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,"1. The results, while promising, are below expectations. The paper hasn’t been able to convince me that GRU-simple (without intervals) isn’t just as well-suited for the task of handling missing inputs as GRU-D. In the main paper, GRU-simple is presented as the main baseline. Yet, it includes a lot of extraneous parameters (the intervals) that, according to Table 5, probably hurts the model more than it helps it. Having a third of it’s parameters being of dubious value, it brings the question of the fairness of the comparison done in the main paper, especially since in the one table where GRU-simple (without intervals) is present, GRU-D doesn’t significantly outperforms it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,"2. My second concern, and biggest, is with some claims that are peppered through the paper. The first is about the relationship with the presence rate of data in the dataset and the diagnostics. I might be wrong, but that only indicates that the doctor in charge of that patient requested the relevant analyses be done according to the patient’s condition. That would mean that an expert system based on this data would always seem to be one step behind.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,"The second claim is the last sentence of the introduction, which sets huge expectations that were not met by the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Another is that “simply concatenating masking and time interval vectors fails to exploit the temporal structure of missing values” is unsubstantiated and actually disproven later in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Yet another is the conclusion that since GRU models displayed the best improvement between a subsample of the dataset and the whole of it means that the improvement is going to continue to grow as more data is added.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,This fails to consider that non-GRU models actually started with much better results than most GRU ones.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJC8LF9ex,Lastly is their claim to capture informative missingness by incorporating masking and time intervals directly inside the GRU architecture.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,1) Summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,This paper investigates the usefulness of decoupling appearance and motion information for the problem of future frame prediction in natural videos.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"The method introduces a novel two-stream encoder-decoder architecture, MCNet, consisting of two separate encoders",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,a convnet on single frames and a convnet+LSTM on sequences of temporal differences,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,followed by combination layers (stacking + convolutions) and a deconvolutional network decoder leveraging also residual connections from the two encoders.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,The architecture is trained end-to-end using the objective and adversarial training strategy of Mathieu et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,2) Contributions,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,The architecture seems novel and is well motivated.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"It is also somewhat related to the two-stream networks of Simonyan & Zisserman, which are very effective for real-world action recognition.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"The qualitative results are numerous, insightful, and very convincing (including quantitatively) on KTH & Weizmann, showing the benefits of decoupling content and motion for simple scenes with periodic motions, as well as the need for residual connections.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,3) Suggestions for improvement,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,Static dataset bias:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"In response to the pre-review concerns about the observed static nature of the qualitative results, the authors added a simple baseline consisting in copying the pixels of the last observed frame.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"On the one hand, the updated experiments on KTH confirm the good results of the method in these conditions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"On the other hand, the fact that this baseline is better than all other methods (not just the authors's) on UCF101 casts some doubts on whether reporting average statistics on UCF101 is insightful enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"Although the authors provide some qualitative analysis pertaining to the quantity of motion, further quantitative analysis seems necessary to validate the performance of this and other methods on future frame prediction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"At least, the results on UCF101 should be disambiguated with respect to the type of scene, for instance by measuring the overall quantity of motion (e.g., l2 norm of time differences) and reporting PSNR and SSIM per quartile / decile.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"Ideally, other realistic datasets than UCF101 should be considered in complement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"For instance, the Hollywood 2 dataset of Marszalek et al would be a good candidate, as it focuses on movies and often contains complex actor, camera, and background motions that would make the ""pixel-copying"" baseline very poor.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"Experiments on video datasets beyond actions, like the KITTI tracking benchmark, would also greatly improve the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,Additional recognition experiments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"As mentioned in pre-review questions, further UCF-101 experiments on action recognition tasks by fine-tuning would also greatly improve the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"Classifying videos indeed requires learning both appearance and motion features, and the two-stream encoder + combination layers of the MCNet+Res architecture seem particularly adapted, if they indeed allowed for unsupervised pre-trainining of content and motion representations, as postulated by the authors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,These experiments would also contribute to dispelling the aforementioned concerns about the static nature of the learned representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,4) Conclusion,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"Overall, this paper proposes an interesting architecture for an important problem, but requires additional experiments to substantiate the claims made by the authors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"If the authors make the aforementioned additional experiments and the results are convincing, then this paper would be clearly relevant for ICLR.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,5) Post-rebuttal final decision,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"The authors did a significant amount of additional work, following the suggestions made by the reviewers, and providing additional compelling experimental evidence.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,This makes this one of the most experimentally thorough ones for this problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,"I, therefore, increase my rating, and suggest to accept this paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEFLFqee,Good job!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The paper presents a method to synthesize string manipulation programs based on a set of input output pairs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The paper focuses on a restricted class of programs based on a simple context free grammar sufficient to solve string manipulation tasks from the FlashFill benchmark.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,A probabilistic generative model called Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN) is presented that assigns a probability to each program's parse tree after a bottom-up and a top-down pass.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Results are presented on a synthetic dataset and a Microsoft Excel benchmark called FlashFill.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The problem of program synthesis is important with a lot of recent interest from the deep learning community.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The approach taken in the paper based on parse trees and recursive neural networks seems interesting and promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"However, the model seems too complicated and unclear at several places (details below).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"On the negative side, the experiments are particularly weak, and the paper does not seem ready for publication based on its experimental results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,I was positive about the paper until I realized that the method obtains an accuracy of 38% on FlashFill benchmark when presented with only 5 input-output examples but the performance degrades to 29% when 10 input-output examples are used.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"This was surprising to the authors too, and they came up with some hypothesis to explain this phenomenon.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"To me, this is a big problem indicating either a bug in the code or a severe shortcoming of the model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Any model useful for program synthesis needs to be applicable to many input-output examples because most complicated programs require many examples to disambiguate the details of the program.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Given the shortcoming of the experiments, I am not convinced that the paper is ready for publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Thus, I recommend weak reject.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,I encourage the authors to address the comments below and resubmit as the general idea seems promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,More comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,I am unclear about the model at several places:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,How is the probability distribution normalized?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Given the nature of bottom-up top-down evaluation of the potentials, should one enumerate over different completions of a program and the compare their exponentiated potentials?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"If so, does this restrict the applicability of the model to long programs as the enumeration of the completions gets prohibitively slow?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,What if you only use 1 input-output pair for each program instead of 5?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Do the results get better?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Section 5.1.2 is not clear to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Can you elaborate by potentially including some examples?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Does your input-output representation pre-supposes a fixed number of input-output examples across tasks (e.g. 5 or 10 for all of the tasks)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Regarding the experiments,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Could you present some baseline results on FlashFill benchmark based on previous work?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Is your method only applicable to short programs?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,(based on the choice of 13 for the number of instructions),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Does a program considered correct when it is identical to a test program, or is it considered correct when it succeeds on a set of held-out input-output pairs?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"When using 100 or more program samples, do you report the accuracy of the best program out of 100 (i.e. recall) or do you first filter the programs based on training input-output pairs and then evaluate a program that is selected?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Your paper is well beyond the recommended limit of 8 pages.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,please consider making it shorter.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,This paper sets out to tackle the program synthesis problem: given a set of input/output pairs discover the program that generated them.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"The authors propose a bipartite model, with one component that is a generative model of tree-structured programs and the other component an input/output pair encoder for conditioning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,They consider applying many variants of this basic model to a FlashFill DSL.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The experiments explore a practical dataset and achieve fine numbers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"The range of models considered, carefulness of the exposition, and basic experimental setup make this a valuable paper for an important area of research.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"I have a few questions, which I think would strengthen the paper, but think it's worth accepting as is.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Questions/Comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"The dataset is a good choice, because it is simple and easy to understand.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"What is the effect of the ""rule based strategy"" for computing well formed input strings?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Clarify what ""backtracking search"" is?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,I assume it is the same as trying to generate the latent function?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,In general describing the accuracy as you increase the sample size could be summarize simply by reporting the log-probability of the latent function.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Perhaps it's worth reporting that?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Not sure if I missed something.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"This paper proposes a model that is able to infer a program from input/output example pairs, focusing on a restricted domain-specific language that captures a fairly wide variety of string transformations, similar to that used by Flash Fill in Excel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The approach is to model successive “extensions” of a program tree conditioned on some embedding of the input/output pairs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Extension probabilities are computed as a function of leaf and production rule embeddings — one of the main contributions is the so-called “Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Net” which computes a globally aware embedding of a leaf by doing something that looks like belief propagation on a tree (but training this operation in an end-to-end differentiable way).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,There are many strong points about this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"In contrast with some of the related work in the deep learning community, I can imagine this being used in an actual application in the near future.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,The R3NN idea is a good one and the authors motivate it quite well.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Moreover, the authors have explored many variants of this model to understand what works well and what does not.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Finally, the exposition is clear (even if it is a long paper), which made this paper a pleasure to read.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Some weaknesses of this paper: the results are still not super accurate, perhaps because the model has only been trained on small programs but is being asked to infer programs that should be much longer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,And it’s unclear why the authors did not simply train on longer programs…  It also seems that the number of I/O pairs is fixed?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"So if I had more I/O pairs, the model might not be able to use those additional pairs (and based on the experiments, more pairs can hurt…).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,"Overall however, I would certainly like to see this paper accepted at ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,Other miscellaneous comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,* Too many e’s in the expansion probability expression — might be better just to write “Softmax”.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0JwFcex,* It’s unclear to me how batching was done in this setting since each program has a different tree topology.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,The enhancements together lead to a clear win as demonstrated by the competition results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,"From Fig 4, the curriculum learning clearly helps with learning over increasingly difficult settings.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,A nice result is that there is no overfitting to the harder classes once they have learned (probably because the curriculum is health and speed).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,"The authors conclude from Fig 5 that the adaptive curriculum is better and more stable that pure A3C; however, this is a bit of a stretch given that graph.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,They go on to say that Pure A3C doesn't learn at all in the harder map but then show no result/graph to back this claim.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,Are the graphs in Fig 5 constructed using a single hyper-parameter sweep?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,I think the authors should report results with many random initializations to make the comparisons more robust,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,A3C and curriculums,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk3mPK5gg,are not really novel but the authors do make use of them in a real system.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"UPDATE: The authors addressed all my concerns in the new version of the paper, so I raised my score and now recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,This paper combines the recent progress in variational autoencoder and autoregressive density modeling in the proposed PixelVAE model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,The paper shows that it can match the NLL performance of a PixelCNN with a PixelVAE that has a much shallower PixelCNN decoder.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,I think the idea of capturing the global structure with a VAE and modeling the local structure with a PixelCNN decoder makes a lot of sense and can prevent the blurry reconstruction/samples of VAE.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,I specially like the hierarchical image generation experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,I have the following suggestions/concerns about the paper:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,1) Is there any experiment showing that using the PixelCNN as the decoder of VAE will result in better disentangling of high-level factors of variations in the hidden code?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"For example, the authors can train a PixelVAE and VAE on MNIST with 2D hidden code and visualize the 2D hidden code for test images and color code each hidden code based on the digit and show that the digits have a better separation in the PixelVAE representation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,A semi-supervised classification comparison between VAE and the PixelVAE will also significantly improve the quality of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"2) A similar idea is also presented in a concurrent ICLR submission ""Variational Lossy Autoencoder"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,It would be interesting to have a discussion included in the paper and compare these works.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,The clarity of the presentation is not satisfying and the experiments are difficult to reproduce.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"4) As pointed out in my pre-review question, it would be great to include two sets of MNIST samples maybe in an appendix section.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,One with PixelCNN and the other with PixelVAE with the same pixelcnn depth to illustrate the hidden code in PixelVAE actually captures the global structure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,The paper combines a hierarchical Variational Autoencoder with PixelCNNs to model the distribution of natural images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,They report good (although not state of the art) likelihoods on natural images and briefly start to explore what information is encoded by the latent representations in the hierarchical VAE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"I believe that combining the PixelCNN with a VAE, as was already suggested in the PixelCNN paper, is an important and interesting contribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"The encoding of high-, mid- and low-level variations at the different latent stages is interesting but seems not terribly surprising, since the size of the image regions the latent variables model is also at the corresponding scale.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,Showing that the PixelCNN improves the latent representation of the VAE with regard to some interesting task would be a much stronger result.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJKYvt5lg,"Also, while the paper claims, that combining the PixelCNN with the VAE reduces the number of computationally expensive autoregressive layers, it remains unclear how much more efficient their whole model is than an PixelCNN with comparable likelihood.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"For example, at NIPS, I saw this Figure 1 being used in a talk (I am not sure anymore by whom, but I don't think it was by the authors), the narrative being ""RNNs now also clearly perform better than local search"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,I thus vote for rejection despite the interesting method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,Update after rebuttal and changes:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,I'm torn about this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"On the one hand, the paper is very well written",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,and I do think the method is very interesting and promising.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,I'd even like to try it and improve it in the future.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"So, from that point of view a clear accept.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"On the other hand, the paper was using extremely poor baselines, making the authors' method appear sensationally strong in comparison, and over the course of many iterations of reviewer questions and anonymous feedback, this has come down to the authors' methods being far inferior to the state of the art.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"That's fine (I expected that all along), but the problem is that the authors don't seem to want this to be true...",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"E.g., they make statements, such as ""We find that both greedy approaches are time-efficient and just a few percents worse than optimality.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"That statement may be true, but it is very well known in the TSP community that it is typically quite trivial to get to a few percent worse than optimality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,What's hard and interesting is to push those last few percent.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"(As a side note: the authors probably don't stop LK-H once it has found the optimal solution, like they do with their own method after finding a local optimum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"LK-H is an anytime algorithm, so even if it ran for a day that doesn't mean that it didn't find the optimal solution after milliseconds",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,and a solution a few percent suboptimal even faster).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Nevertheless, since the claims have been toned down over the course of the many iterations, I was starting to feel more positive about this paper when just re-reading it.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"That is, until I got to the section on Knapsack solving.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"The version of the paper I reviewed was not bad here, as it at least stated two simple heuristics that yield optimal solutions:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"""Two simple heuristics are ExpKnap, which employs brand-and-bound with Linear Programming bounds (Pisinger, 1995), and MinKnap, which employs dynamic programming with enumerative bounds (Pisinger, 1997).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Exact solutions can also be optained by quantizing the weights to high precisions and then performing dynamic programming with a pseudo-polynomial complexity (Bertsimas & Demir, 2002).""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"That version then went on to show that these simple heuristics were already optimal, just like their own method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"In a revision between December 11 and 14, however, that paragraph, along with the optimal results of ExpKnap and MinKnap seems to have been dropped, and the authors instead introduced two new poor baseline methods (random search and greedy).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,This was likely in an effort to find some methods that are not optimal on these very easy instances.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"I personally find it pointless to present results for random search here, as nobody would use that for TSP.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"It's like comparing results on MNIST against a decision stump (yes, you'll do better than that, but that is not surprising).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,The results for greedy are interesting to see.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"However, dropping the strong results of the simple heuristics ExpKnap and MinKnap (and their entire discussion) appears unresponsible, since the resulting table in the new version of the paper now suggests that the authors' method is better than all baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Of course, if all that one is after is a column of bold numbers for ones own approach that's what one can do, but I don't find it responsible to hide the better baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Also, why don't the authors try at least the same OR-tools solver from Google that they tried for TSP?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,And that's OK; you don't typically beat an entire field with one paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"If the authors clearly stated that throughout, I would clearly argue for acceptance ... (Maybe that's not the norm in machine learning, but I don't think you have to beat everything quite yet if your approach is very different and promising",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Concretely, I would recommend that the authors do the following:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Put the original Figure 1 back in, but dropping the previous poor local search and labelling the line at 1.0 ""local search (LK-H) = exact (Concorde)"".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,Put the other baselines back into the Knapsack section,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,Make sure the wording clearly states throughout that the method is still quite far from the state of the art (it's perfectly fine to strongly state that the direction is very promising).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Overall, this paper has to watch out for not becoming an example of promising too much (some would call it hype-generation) before having state-of-the-art results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"(I believe the previous comparison against local search fell into that category, and now the current section on Knapsack does.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,I believe that would do a great disservice to our community since it builds up an expectation that the field cannot live up to (and that's a recipe for building up a bubble that has no other chance but burst).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJY3vK9eg,"Having said all that, I think the paper can be saved if the authors embrace that they are still far away from the state of the art.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,This paper proposes a method for link prediction on Knowledge Bases.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,The method contains 2 main innovations: (1) an iterative inference process that allows the model to refine its predictions and (2) a shared memory component.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,"Thanks to these 2 elements, the model introduced in the paper achieved remarkable results on two benchmarks.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,* The main problem with this paper is that there is little explanation of how and why the two new elements aforementioned are leading to such better results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,For instance:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,- What are the performance without the shared memory? And when its size is grown?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,- How does the performance is impacted when one varies Tmax from 1 to 5 (which the chosen value for the experiments I assume)? This gives an indications of how often the termination gate works.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,- It would also be interesting to give the proportion of examples for which the inference is terminated before hitting Tmax.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,- What is the proportion of examples for which the prediction changed along several inference iterations?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,"This paper proposes a new way for knowledge base completion which highlights: 1) adopting an implicit shared memory, which makes no assumption about its structure and is completely learned during training; 2) modeling a multi-step search process that can decide when to terminate.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,"The main concern is that this paper presents too little analysis about how it works and whether it is sensitive to the hyper-parameters, besides that only reporting a final model on WN18 and FB15k.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,One key hyper-parameter I believe is the size of shared memory (using 64 for the experiments).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,"I don’t think that this number should be fixed for all tasks, at least it should depend on the KB scale.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1PRvK9el,I appreciate your attempts on the shortest path synthetic task.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Here, local parameters are optimised holding generative parameters fixed (line 3 of Algorithm 1).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The optimised local parameters are then used in the gradient step of the generative parameters (line 4 of Algorithm 1).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Finally, global variational parameters are also updated (line 5).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Whereas indeed other authors have proposed to optimise local parameters, I think that deriving this procedure from the more familiar SVI makes the contribution less of a trick and easier to relate to.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,Some things aren't entirely clear to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,I think it would have been nice if the authors had shown the functional form of the gradient used in step 3 of Algorithm 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The gradient step for global variational parameters (line 5 of Algorithm 1) uses the very first prediction of local parameters (thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3), this is unclear to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Perhaps I am missing a fundamental reason why that has to be the case (either way, please clarify).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The authors argue that this optimisation turns out helpful to modelling sparse data because there is evidence that the generative model p_\theta(x|z) suffers from poor initialisation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Please, discuss why you expect the initialisation problem to be worse in the case of sparse data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The final contribution is a neat procedure to derive word embeddings from the generative model parameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,These embeddings are then used to interpret what the model has learnt.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Interestingly, these word embeddings are context-sensitive once that the latent variable models an entire document.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"About Figures 2a and 2b: the caption says that solid lines indicate validation perplexity for M=1 (no optimisation of local parameters) and dashed lines indicate M=100 (100 iterations of optimisation of local parameters), but the legends of the figures suggest a different reading.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"If I interpret the figures based on the caption, then it seems that indeed deeper networks exposed to more data benefit from optimisation of local parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,Are the authors pretty sure that in Figure 2b models with M=1 have reached a plateau (so that longer training would not allow them to catch up with M=100 curves)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"As the authors explain in the caption, x-axis is not comparable on running time, thus the question.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The analysis of singular values seems like an interesting way to investigate how the model is using its capacity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"However, I can barely interpret Figures 2c and 2d, I think the authors could have walked readers through them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,As for the word embedding I am missing an evaluation on a predictive task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Also, while illustrative, Table 2b is barely reproducible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The text reads ""we create a document comprising a subset of words in the the context’s Wikipedia page."" which is rather vague.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,I wonder whether this construct needs to be carefully designed in order to get Table 2b.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"In sum, I have a feeling that the inference technique and the embedding technique are both useful, but perhaps they should have been presented separately so that each could have been explored in greater depth.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,First I would like to apologize for the delay in reviewing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Summary : In this paper a variational inference is adapted to deep generative models, showing improvement for non-negative sparse dataset. The authors offer as well a method to interpret the data through the model parameters.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The writing is generally clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The methods seem correct.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The introspection approach appears to be original.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,I found very interesting the experiment on the polysemic word embedding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,I would however have like to see how the obtained embedding would perform with respect to other more common embeddings in solving a supervised task.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,This paper introduces three tricks for training deep latent variable models on sparse discrete data:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,1) tf-idf weighting,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,2) Iteratively optimizing variational parameters after initializing them with an inference network,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,3) A technique for improving the interpretability of the deep model,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,The first idea is sensible but rather trivial as a contribution.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The second idea is also sensible, but is conceptually not novel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,What is new is the finding that it works well for the dataset used in this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The third idea is interesting, and seems to give qualitatively reasonable results.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The quantitative semantic similarity results don’t seem that convincing, but I am not very familiar with the relevant literature and therefore cannot make a confident judgement on this issue.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"This paper presents a small trick to improve the model quality of variational autoencoders (further optimizing the ELBO while initializing it from the predictions of the q network, instead of just using those directly) and the idea of using Jacobian vectors to replace simple embeddings when interpreting variational autoencoders.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"The idea of the Jacobian as a natural replacement for embeddings is interesting, as it does seem to cleanly generalize the notion of embeddings from linear models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"It'd be interesting to see comparisons with other work seeking to provide context-specific embeddings, either by clustering or by smarter techniques (like Neelakantan et al, Efficient non-parametric estimation of multiple embeddings per word in vector space, or Chen et al A Unified Model for Word Sense Representation and Disambiguation).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,With the evidence provided in the experimental section of the paper it's hard to be convinced that the Jacobian of VAE-generated embeddings is substantially better at being context-sensitive than prior work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"Similarly, the idea of further optimizing the ELBO is interesting but not fully explored.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,"It's unclear, for example, what is the tradeoff between the complexity of the q network and steps further optimizing the ELBO, in terms of compute versus accuracy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,Overall the ideas in this paper are good,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Chut9xl,but I'd like to see them a little more fleshed out.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,This paper proposed an integration of memory network with reinforcement learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"The experimental data is simple, but the model is very interesting and relatively novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,There are some questions about the model:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,1. how does the model extend to the case with multiple variables in a single sentence?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"2. If the answer is out of vocabulary, how would the model handle it?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"3. I hope the authors can provide more analysis about the curriculum learning part, since it is very important for the RL model training.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"4. In the training, in each iteration, how the data samples were selected, by random or from simple one depth to multiple depth?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"This paper introduces a nice dataset/data generator that creates bAbI like tasks, except where the questioning answering agent is required to clarify the values of some variables in order to succeed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,I think the baselines the authors use to test the tasks are appropriate.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"I am a bit worried that the tasks may be too easy (as the bAbI tasks have been), but still, I think locally these will be useful.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"Some of these variables must be known to solve the question, thus the agent must learn to query for the values of these variables.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"Interestingly, one can now measure both the performance of the agent in correctly answering the question, and its efficiency in asking for the values of the correct unknown variables (and not variables that are unnecessary to answer the question).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"This inferring of unknown variables goes beyond what is required for the vanilla version of the bAbI tasks, which are now more or less solved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"The paper is well-written, and the contributions are clear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"Due to the very limited vocabulary and structure of the bAbI problems in general, I think these tasks (and variants on them) should be viewed more as basic reasoning tasks than natural language understanding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"I’m not convinced by the claim of the paper that this really tests the ‘interaction’ capabilities of agents – while the task is phrased as a kind of interaction, I think it’s more aptly described by simply ‘inferring important unknown variables’, which (while important) is more related to reasoning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,I’m not sure whether the connection of this ability to ‘interaction’ is more a superficial one.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"That being said, it is certainly true that conversational agents will need basic reasoning abilities to converse meaningfully with humans.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"I sympathise with the general goal of the bAbI tasks, which is to test these reasoning abilities in synthetic environments, that are just complicated enough (but not more) to drive the construction of interesting models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ0-tY5xe,"I am convinced by the authors that their extension to these tasks are interesting and worthy of future investigation, and thus I recommend the acceptance of the paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,"This paper presents a theoretical treatment of transformation groups applied to convnets, and presents some empirical results showing more efficient usage of network parameters.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,The basic idea of steerability makes huge sense and seems like a very important idea to develop.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,"It is also a very old idea in image processing and goes back to Simoncelli, Freeman, Adelson, as well as Perona/Greenspan and others in the early 1990s.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,This paper approaches it through a formal treatment of group theory.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,But at the end of the day the idea seems pretty simple - the feature representation of a transformed image should be equivalent to a transformed feature representation of the original image.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,"Given that the authors are limiting their analysis to discrete groups - for example rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 deg.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,- the formalities brought in from the group theoretic analysis seem a bit overkill.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,I'm not sure what this buys us in the end.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,"it seems the real challenge lies in implementing continuous transformations, so if the theory could guide us in that direction it would be immensely helpful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQKYt5ll,Also the description of the experiments is fairly opaque.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,The paper proposed a multi-memory mechanism that memorizes different information into different components/entities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,It could be considered as a mixture model in RNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,This is a very interesting model and result is convincing.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,A limitation is that we do not know how to generalize to some unseen entities and how to visualize what entities the model learned.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,This paper proposes a new memory augmented neural network (MANN) model called recurrent entity network (EntNet).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,EntNet can be considered as a bank of RNNs with gating mechanism to update the hidden states of the RNNs and the hidden states act like the memory slots.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,The model is very much relevant to NTM style architectures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,It is known that training the controller in NTM to read/write from memory slots is challenging.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,EntNet cleverly pushes the complexity of the controller to individual memory slots.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,It is as if each slot has a controller and they all act in a distributed manner.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,Authors report strong results in bAbI tasks where the model achieves state of the art performance.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,Synthetic world experiments justify that the model learns to capture the world dynamics.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,However it is not clear if this will be scalable to complex real tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,EntNet also achieves reasonable performance with one-shot reading of the passage in CBT task.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,I see EntNet as a generalization of RNNs and has some advantage over NTMs when it comes to training complexity.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,This is definitely a good contribution to the conference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,I see that EntNet can have several other applications in future.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,2. There are so many training details in the paper which makes it difficult to reproduce the results. Can the authors release the source code to reproduce all the results in the paper? I am willing to increase my rating if authors can release the code.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,The work proposes a variant of a recurrent neural network that can selectively update a fixed number of multiple memory slots to update entity states.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,"The architecture is well motivated, especially with the motivating example, and the operation is shown to validate the intuition as shown in visualizations.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJTKKKqeg,I consider the work as a good conference contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,First I would like to apologize for the late review.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,This paper proposes an extension of the NPI model (Reed & de Freitas) by using an extension of the probabilistic stacks introduced in Mikolov et al..,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,This allows them to train their model with less supervision than Reed & de Freitas.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,Overall the model is a nice extension of NPI.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"While it requires less supervision than NPI, it still requires ""sequences of elementary operations paired with environment observations, and [...] a couple of examples which include the full abstraction hierarchy"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,This may limit the scope of this work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"The paper claims that their ""method is leverages stronger supervision in the form of elementary action sequences rather than just input-output examples (sic).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Such sequences are relatively easy to gather in many natural settings"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"It would be great if the authors clarify what they mean by ""relatively easy to gather in many natural settings"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"They also claim that ""the additional supervision improves the data efficiency and allow our technique to scale to more complicated problems"".",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"However, this paper only addresses two toy problems which are neither ""natural settings"" nor of a large scale (or at least not larger than those addressed in the related literature, see Zaremba et al. for addition).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"In the introduction, the author states that ""Existing techniques, however, cannot be applied on data like this because it does not contain the abstraction hierarchy.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"What are the ""existing techniques"", they are referring to?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,This work only addresses the problem of long addition and puzzle solving in a block world.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Afaik, Zaremba et al. has shown that with no supervision, it can solve the long addition problem and",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Sukhbaatar et al. (""Mazebase: A sandbox for learning from games"") shows that a memory network can solve puzzles in a blockworld with little supervision.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"In the conclusion,  the author states that ""remarkably, NPL achieves state-of-the-art performances with much less supervision compared to existing models, making itself more applicable to real-world applications where full program traces are hard to get.""",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"However for all the experiments, they ""include a small number of FULL samples"" (FULL == ""samples with full program traces"").",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Unfortunately even if this means that they need less FULL examples, they still need ""full program traces"", contradicting their final claim.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Moreover, as shown figure 7, their model does not use a ""small number of FULL samples"" but rather a significantly smaller amount of FULL examples than NPI, i.e., 16 vs 128.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"""All experiments were run with 10 different random seeds"": does the environment change as well between the runs, i.e. are the FULL examples different between the runs?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"If it is the case and since you select the best run (on a validation set), the NPL model does not consume 16 FULL examples but 160 FULL examples for nanoCraft.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Concerning the NanoCraft example, it would be good to have more details about how the examples are generated: how do you make sure that the train/val/test sets are different?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,How the rectangular shape are generated?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"If I consider all possible rectangles in a 6x6 grid, there are (6x6)x(6x6)/2 = 648 possibilities, thus taking 256 examples sum up to ~40% of the total number of rectangles.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"This does not even account for the fact that from an initial state, many rectangles can be made, making my estimate probably lower than the real coverage of examples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Concerning the addition, it would interesting to show what an LSTM would do: Take a 2 layer LSTM that takes the 2 current digits as an input and produce the current output ( ""123+45"" would be input[0] = [3,5], input[1]=[2,4], input[2]=[1, 0] and output[0] = 8...).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,I would be curious to see how such baseline would work.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Also, would it be possible to compare with Zaremba et al.?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,"Finally, as discussed previously with the authors, it would be good if they discuss more in length the relation between their probabilistic stacks and Mikolov et al..",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,They have a lot of similarities and it is not addressed in the current version.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJjiFK5gx,It should be addressed in the section describing the approach.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,This paper investigates deep generative models with multiple stochastic nodes and gives them meaning by semi-supervision.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"From a methodological point of view, there is nothing fundamentally novel (it is very similar to the semi-supervised work of Kingma et al; although this work has sometimes more than two latent nodes, it is not a complex extension).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"There is a fairly classical auxiliary variable trick used to make sure the inference network for y is trained over all data points (by supposing y is in fact is a latent variable with an observation \tilde y; the observation is y if y is observed, or uninformative for unobserved y).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Overall this is a well written, interesting paper, but lacking in terms of methodological advances.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,Minor:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,I feel the title is a bit too general for the content of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"I personally don't agree with the strong contrast made between deep generative models and graphical models (deep generative models are graphical models, but they are more typically learned and un-interpretable than classical graphical models; and having multiple stochastic variables is not exclusive to graphical models, see DRAW, Deep Kalman Filter, Recurrent VAE, etc.).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"The word 'structure' is a bit problematic; here, the paper seems more concerned with disentangling and semanticizing the latent representation of a generative model by supervision.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,It is debatable whether the models themselves have structure.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,This paper proposed a variant of the semi-supervised VAE model which leads to a unified objective for supervised and unsupervised VAE.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,This variant gives software implementation of these VAE models more flexibility in specifying which variables are supervised and which are not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"This development introduces a few extra terms compared to the original semi-supervised VAE formulation proposed by Kingma et al., 2014.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,From the experiment results it seems that these terms do not do much as the new formulation and the performance difference between the proposed method and Kingma et al. 2014 are not very significant (Figure 5).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,Therefore the benefit of the new formulation is likely to be just software engineering flexibility and convenience.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"This flexibility and convenience is nice to have, but it is better to demonstrate a few situations where the proposed method can be applied while for other previous methods it is non-trivial to do.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The paper's title and the way it is written make me expect a lot more than what is currently in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"I was expecting to see, for example, structured hidden variable model for the posterior (page 4, top), or really ""structured interpretation"" of the generative model (title), but I didn't see any of these.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The main contribution of this paper (a variant of the semi-supervised VAE model) is quite far from these.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Aside from these, the plug-in estimation for discrete variables only works when the function h(x,y) is a continuous function of y.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"If however, h(x, y) is not continuous in y, for example h takes one form when y=1 and another form when y=2, then the approach of using Expectation[y] to replace y will not work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Therefore the ""plug-in"" estimation has its limitations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,This paper introduces a variant of the semi-supervised variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The authors present a way of introducing structure (observed variables) inside the recognition network.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"I find that the presentation of the inference with auxiliary variables could be avoided, as it actually makes the presentation unnecessarily complicated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Specifically, the expressions with auxiliary variables are helpful for devising a unified implementation, but modeling-wise one can get the same model without these auxiliary variables and recover a minimal extension of VAE where part of the generating space is actually observed.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"The observed variables mean that the posterior needs to also condition on those, so as to incorporate the information they convey.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"The way this is done in this paper is actually not very different from Kingma et al. 2014, and I am surprised that the experiments show a large deviation in these two methods' results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Given the similarity of the models, it'd be useful if the authors could give a possible explanation on the superiority of their method compared to Kingma et al. 2014.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"By the way, I was wondering if the experimental setup is the same as in Kingma et al. 2014 for the results of Fig.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,5 (bottom) - the authors mention that they use CNNs for feature extraction but from the paper it's not clear if Kingma et al.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,do the same.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"On a related note, I was wondering the same for the comparison with Jampani et al. 2015.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"In particular, is that model also using the same rate of supervision for a fair comparison?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The experiment in section 4.3 is interesting and demonstrates a useful property of the approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The discussion of the supervision rate (and the pre-review answer) is helpful in giving some insight about what is a successful training protocol to use in semi-supervised learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Overall, the paper is interesting but the title and introduction made me expect something more from it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"From the title I expected a method for interpreting general deep generative models, instead the described approach was about a semi-supervised variant of VAE - naturally including labelled examples disentangles the latent space, but this is a general property of any semi-supervised probabilistic model and not unique to the approach described here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Moreover, from the intro I expected to see a more general approximation scheme for the variational posterior (similar to Ranganath et al. 2015  which trully allows very flexible distributions), however this is not the case here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Given the above, the contributions of this paper are in defining a slight variant of the semi-supervised VAE, and (perhaps more importantly) formulating it in a way that is amendable to easier automation in terms of software.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,But methodologically there is not much contribution to the current literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,The authors mention that they plan to extend the framework in the probabilistic programming setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,It seems indeed that this would be a very promising and useful extension.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJtN5K9gx,"Minor note: three of Kingma's papers are all cited in the main text as Kingma et al. 2014, causing confusion. I suggest using Kingma et al. 2014a etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"This paper proposes to use an empirical Bayesian approach to learn the parameters of a neural network, and their priors.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,A mixture model prior over the weights leads to a clustering effect in the weight posterior distributions (which are approximated with delta peaks).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,This clustering effect can exploited for parameter quantisation and compression of the network parameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,The authors show that this leads to compression rates and predictive accuracy comparable to related approaches.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"Earlier work [Han et al. 2015] is based on a three-stage process of pruning small magnitude weights, clustering the remaining ones, and updating the cluster centres to optimise performance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"The current work provides a more principled approach that does not have such an ad-hoc multi-stage structure, but a single iterative optimisation process.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"A first experiment, described in section 6.1 shows that an empirical Bayes’ approach, without the use of hyper priors, already leads to a pronounced clustering effect and to setting many weights to zero.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,Figure 2 shows the performance of the  different points in the hyper-parameter space that have been evaluated (each trained network gives an accuracy-compressionrate point in the graph).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"The text claims that best results lie on a line, this seems a little opportunistic interpretation given the limited data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"Moreover, it would be useful to add a small discussion on whether such a linear relationship would be expected or not.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"Section 6.3 describes results obtained for both CNN models and compares results to the recent results of (Han et al., 2015) and (Guo et al., 2016).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"The authors state that their current algorithm is too slow to be useful for larger models such as VGG-19, but they do briefly report some results obtained for this model (but do not compare to related work).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"It would be useful here to explain what slows the training down with respect to standard training without the weight clustering approach, and how the proposed algorithm scales in terms of the relevant quantities of the data and the model.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"Another point that would deserve further discussion is how the hyper-parameter search is performed ( not using test data I assume), and how the compared methods dealt with the search over hyper-parameters to determine the accuracy-compression tradeoff.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,"Ideally, I think, methods should be evaluated across different points on this trade-off.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJGwcKclx,The authors propose a method to compress neural networks by retraining them while putting a mixture of Gaussians prior on the weights with learned means and variances which then can be used to compress the neural network by first setting all weights to the mean of their infered mixture component (resulting in a possible loss of precision) and storing the network in a format which saves only the fixture index and exploits the sparseness of the weights that was enforced in training.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"Briefly, some comments on the authors' response:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"1. ""minibatches are constructed to not only have a random subset of training examples but also be balanced w.r.t. to epitome assignment (Alg. 1, ln. 4).""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,Nice!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,This makes me feel better about why all the epitomes will be used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,2. I don't think your response addresses why C_vae would trade off between data reconstruction and being factorial. The approximate posterior is factorial by construction,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,there's nothing in C_vae that can make it more or less factorial.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"3. ""For C_vae to have zero contribution from the KL term of a particular z_d (in other words, that unit is deactivated), it has to have all the examples in the training set be deactivated (KL term of zero) for that unit""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,This isn't true.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"A standard VAE can set the variance to 1 and the mean to 0 (KL term of 0) for some examples in the training set, and have non-zero KL for other training examples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"4. The VAE loss is trained on a lower bound on the log likelihood, though it does have a term that looks like reconstruction error. Naively, I would imagine that if it overfits, this would correspond to data samples becoming more likely under the generative model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,5/6.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,See Parzen concerns above.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"It's strange to train a binary model, and then treat it's probability of activation as a sample in a continuous space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"6. ""we can only evaluate the model from its samples""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,I don't believe this is true.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"You are training on a lower bound on the log likelihood, which immediately provides another method of quantitative evaluation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"Additionally, you could use techniques such as AIS to compute the exact log likelihood.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"7. I don't believe Parzen window evaluation is a better measure of model quality, even in terms of sample generation, than log likelihood.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"The paper presents a version of a variational autoencoder that uses a discrete latent variable that masks the activation of the latent code, making only a subset (an ""epitome"") of the latent variables active for a given sample.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"The justification for this choice is that by letting different latent variables be active for different samples, the model is forced to use more of the latent code than a usual VAE.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"While the problem of latent variable over pruning is important and has been highlighted in the literature before in the context of variational inference, the proposed solution doesn't seem to solve it beyond, for instance, a mixture of VAEs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"Indeed, a mixture of VAEs would have been a great baseline for the experiments in the paper, as it uses a categorical variable (the mixture component) along with multiple VAEs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"The main difference between a mixture and an epitomic VAE is the sharing of parameters between the different ""mixture components"" in the epitomic VAE case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,The experimental section presents misleading results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,1. The log-likelihood of the proposed models is evaluated with Parzen window estimator. A significantly more accurate lower bound on likelihood that is available for the VAEs is not reported. In reviewer's experience continuous MNIST likelihood of upwards of 900 nats is easy to obtain with a modestly sized VAE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"2. The exposition changes between dealing with binary MNIST and continuous MNIST experiments. This is confusing, because these versions of the dataset present different challenges for modeling with likelihood-based models. Continuous MNIST is harder to model with high-capacity likelihood optimizing models, because the dataset lies in a proper subspace of the 784-dimensional space (some pixels are always or almost always equal to 0), and hence probability density can be arbitrarily large on this subspace. Models that try to maximize the likelihood often exploit this option of maximizing the likelihood by concentrating the probability around the subspace at the expense of actually modeling the data. The samples of a well-tuned VAE trained on binary MNIST (or a VAE trained on continuous MNIST to which noise has been appropriately added) tend to look much better than the ones presented in experimental results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"3. The claim that the VAE uses its capacity to ""overfit"" to the training data is not justified. No evidence is presented that the reconstruction likelihood on the training data is significantly higher than the reconstruction likelihood on the test data. It's misleading to use a technical term like ""overfitting"" to mean something else.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"4. The use of dropout in dropout VAE is not specified: is dropout applied to the latent variables, or to the hidden layers of the encoder/decoder? The two options will exhibit very different behaviors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"5. MNIST eVAE samples and reconstructions look more like a more diverse version of 2d VAE samples/reconstructions - they are blurry, the model doesn't encode precise position of strokes. This is consistent with an interpretation of eVAE as a kind of mixture of smaller VAEs, rather than a higher-dimensional VAE. It is misleading to claim that it outperforms a high-dimensional VAE based on this evidence.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,In reviewer's opinion the paper is not yet ready for publication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,A stronger baseline VAE evaluated with evidence lower bound (or another reliable method) is essential for comparing the proposed eVAE to VAEs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"This paper proposes an elegant solution to a very important problem in VAEs, namely that the model over-regularizes itself by killing off latent dimensions.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,People have used annealing of the KL term and “free bits” to hack around this issue but a better solution is needed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,The offered solution is to introduce sparsity for the latent representation: for every input only a few latent distributions will be activated but across the dataset many latents can still be learned.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,What I didn’t understand is why the authors need the topology in this latent representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,Why not place a prior over arbitrary subsets of latents?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,That seems to increase the representational power a lot without compromising the solution to the problem you are trying to solve.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,"Now the number of ways the latents can combine is no longer exponentially large, which seems a pity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,The first paragraph on p.7 is a mystery to me: “An effect of this …samples”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,How can under-utilization of model capacity lead to overfitting?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,The experiments are modest but sufficient.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk3F5Y9lx,This paper has an interesting idea that may resolve a fundamental issue of VAEs and thus deserves a place in this conference.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The paper proposes a new criterion (sample importance) to study the impact of samples during the training of deep neural networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"This criterion is not clearly defined (the term \phi^t_{i,j} is never defined, only \phi^t_i is defined; Despite the unclear definition, it is understood that sample importance is the squared l2 norm of the gradient for a sample i and at time t strangely scaled by the squared learning rate (the learning rate should have nothing to do with the importance of a sample in this context).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The paper presents experiments on the well known MNIST and CIFAR datasets with correspondingly appropriate network architectures and choice of hyper-parameters and initialisations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The size of the hidden layers is a bit small for Mnist and very small for CIFAR (this could explain the very poor performance in figure 6: 50% error on CIFAR),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The study of the evolution of sample importance during training depending on layers seems to lead to trivial conclusions,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,- “the overall sample importance is different under different epochs” => yes the norm of the gradient is expected to vary,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"- “Output layer always has the largest average sample importance per parameter, and its contribution reaches the maximum in the early training stage and then drops” => 1. yes since the gradient flows backwards, the gradient is expected to be stronger for the output layer and it is expected to become more diffuse as it propagates to lower layers which are not stable. As learning progresses one would expect the output layer to have progressively smaller gradients. 2. the norm of the gradient depends on the scaling of the variables",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The question of Figure 4 is absurd “Is Sample Importance the same as Negative log-likelihood of a sample?”.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,Of course not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The results are very bad on CIFAR which discredits the applicability of those results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,On Mnist performance is not readable (figure 7): Error rate should only be presented between 0 and 10 or 20%,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Despite these important issues (there are others), the paper manages to raises some interesting things: the so-called easy samples and hard samples do seem to correspond (although the study is very preliminary in this regard) to what would intuitively be considered easy (the most representative/canonical samples) and hard (edge cases) samples.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,Also the experiments are very well presented.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"This paper examines the so called ""Sample Importance"" of each sample of a training data set, and its effect to the overall learning process.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The paper shows empirical results that shows different training cases induces bigger gradients at different stages of learning and different layers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The paper shows some interesting results contrary to the common curriculum learning ideas of using easy training samples first.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"However, it is unclear how one should define ""Easy"" training cases.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"In addition, the experiments demonstrating ordering either NLL or SI is worse than mixed or random batch construction to be insightful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,Possible Improvements:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"It would be nice to factor out the magnitudes of the gradients to the contribution of ""sample importance"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Higher gradient (as a function of a particular weight vector) can be affected weight/initialization, thereby introducing noise to the model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"It would also be interesting if improvements based on ""Sample importance"" could be made to the batch selection algorithm to beat the baseline of random batch selection.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,Overall this paper is a good paper with various experiments examining how various samples in SGD influences the various aspect of training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,(paper summary),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"The authors introduce the notion of “sample importance”, meant to measure the influence of a particular training example on the training of a deep neural network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"This quantity is closely related to the squared L2 norm of the gradient, where the summation is performed over (i) parameters of a given layer or (ii) across all parameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Summing this quantity across time gives the “overall importance”, used to tease apart easy from hard examples.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"From this quantity, the authors illustrate the impact of [easy,hard] example during training, and their impact on layer depth.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,(detailed review),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,I have several objections to this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"First and foremost, I am not convinced of the “sample importance” as a meaningful metric.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"As previously mentioned, the magnitude of gradients will change significantly during learning, and I am not sure what conclusions one can draw from \sum_t g_i^t vs \sum_t g_j^t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"For example, gradients tend to have higher norms early in training than at convergence, in which case weighting each gradient equally seems problematic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"I tried illustrating the above with a small thought experiment during the question period: “if” the learning rate were too high, training may not even converge in which case sample importance would be ill-defined.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Having a measure which depends on the learning rate seems problematic to me, as does the use of the L2 norm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"The “input Fisher” norm, \mathbb{E} \frac{\partial \log p} {\partial x} (for a given time-step) may be better suited, as it speaks directly to the sensitivity of the classifier to the input x (and is insensitive to changes in the mean gradient norm).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,But again summing Fisher norms across time may not be meaningful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The experimental analysis also seems problematic.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,The authors claim from Fig. 2 that output layers are primarily learnt in the early stage of training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"However, this is definitely not the case for CIFAR-10 and is debatable for MNIST: sample importance remains high for all layers during training, despite a small spike early on the output layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Fig 2. (lower, middle) and Fig. 6 also seems to highlight an issue with the SI measure: the SI is dominated by the input layer which has the most parameters, and can thus more readily impact the gradient norm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,Different model architectures may have yielded different conclusions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1IRctqxg,"Had the authors managed to use the SI to craft a better curriculum, this would have given significant weight to the measure.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_sjFqgx,Critically the paper glosses over the major issues of demonstrating the proposed DSL is a valid probabilistic model and how training is performed to fit the model to data (there is clearly not a gradient-based training approach used).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,"Since there are only a few sequences of human demonstrations, the paper first segments the sequences into fragments so that the features are roughly invariant on the corresponding fragments across sequences, then clusters and finds most discriminative features on those fragments, and uses them as the reward function.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,The features are from pre-trained deep models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,The idea is simple and seems quite effective in picking the right reward functions.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,"- an even simpler baseline than what is proposed in the paper would be the following procedure: simply use all frames of the recorded trajectories, calculate the distance to them in feature space and weights them according to their time as in the approach proposed in the paper. How well would that work ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,2) I understand the desire to combine the extracted reward function with a simple RL method but believe the used simple controller could potentially introduce a significant bias in the experiments since it requires initialization from an expert trajectory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,As a direct consequence of this initialization the RL procedure is already started close to a good solution and the extracted reward function is potentially only queried in a small region around what was observed in the initial set of images (perhaps with the exception of the human demonstrations).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,Without an additional experiment it is thus unclear how well the presented approach will work in combination with other RL methods for training the controller.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee,3) I understand that the low number of available images excludes training a deep neural net directly for the task at hand but one has to wonder how other baselines would do.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,SYNOPSIS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The paper proposes a new neural network-based model for reading comprehension (reading a passage of text and answering questions based on the passage).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"It is similar in spirit to several other recent models, with the main exception that it is able to predict answers of different lengths, as opposed to single words/tokens/entities.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"The authors compare their model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), and show improvements over the baselines, while apparently lagging quite far behind the current state of the art reported on the SQuAD leaderboard.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,THOUGHTS:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The main novelty of the method is to be able to identify phrases of different lengths as possible answers to the question.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"However, both approaches considered",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"using a POS pattern trie tree to filter out word sequences with POS tags matching those of answers in the training set, and brute-force enumeration of all phrases up to length N",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"seem somewhat orthogonal to the idea of ""learning end-to-end "" an answer chunk extraction model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Furthermore, as other reviews have pointed out, it seems that the linguistic features actually contribute a lot to the final accuracy (Table 3).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"One could argue that these are easy to obtain using standard taggers, but it takes away even more from the idea of an ""end-to-end trained"" system.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"The paper is generally well written, but there are several crucial sections in parts describing the model where it was really hard for me to follow the descriptions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"In particular, the attention mechanism seems fairly standard to me in a seq2seq sense (i.e. there is nothing architecturally novel about it, as is for instance the case with the Gated Attentive Reader).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"I may be missing something, but even after the clarification round I still don't understand how it is novel compared to standard attention used in for instance seq2seq models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Finally, although the method is shown to outperform the baseline method reported in the original paper introducing the SQuAD dataset, it currently seems to be 12th (out of 15 systems) on the leaderboard (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Of course, it may be that further training and hyperparameter optimizations may improve these results.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"However, I would like to see more analysis on the dynamic chunking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,Why this approach is a good approach for representing answer chunks?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Given the representation of the chunk is constructed by the first and the end word representations generated by a convolution network, I am not sure about the ability of this representation to capture the long answer phrases.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,SUMMARY.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The paper propose a reading-comprehension question answering system for the recent QA task where answers of a question can be either single tokens or spans in the given text passage.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The model first encodes the passage and the query using a recurrent neural network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,With an attention mechanism the model calculates the importance of each word on the passage with respect to each word in the question.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The encoded words in the passage are concatenated with the attention; the resulting vector is re-encoded with a further RNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Three convolutional neural networks with different filter size (1,2,3-gram) are used to further capture local features.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,Candidate answers are selected either matching POS patterns of answers in the training set or choosing all possible text span until a certain length.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"Each candidate answer has three representations, one for each n-gram representation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The compatibility of these representation with the question representation is then calculated.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The scores are combined linearly and used for calculating the probability of the candidate answer being the right answer for the question.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The method is tested on the SQUAD dataset and outperforms the proposed baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,OVERALL JUDGMENT,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The method presented in this paper is interesting but not very motivated in some points.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"For example, it is not explained why in the attention mechanism it is beneficial to concatenate the original passage encoding with the attention-weighted ones.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,The contributions of the paper are moderately novel proposing mainly the attention mechanism and the convolutional re-encoding.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1te3Fqel,"In fact, combining questions and passages and score their compatibility has became a fairly standard procedure in all QA models.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S19eAF9ee,"The paper, model and experiments are decent but I have some concerns:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S19eAF9ee,"1. The proposed model is not exceptionally novel from a technical perspective. I usually don't mind if this is the case provided that the authors make up for the deficiency with thorough experimental evaluation, clear write up, and interesting insights into the pros/cons of the approach with respect to previous models. In this case I lean towards this not being the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S19eAF9ee,2. The experiment results section is rather terse and light on interpretation. I'm not fully up to date on the latest of Penn Tree Bank language modeling results but I do know that it is a hotly contested and well-known dataset. I am surprised to see a comparison only to Zaremba et al 2014 where I would expect to see multiple other results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S19eAF9ee,"3. The writing is not very clear and the authors don't make sufficiently strong attempt to compare the models or provide insight or comparisons into why the proposed model works better. In particular, unless I'm mistaken the word probabilities are a function of the neighborhood in the graph. What is the width of this graph? For example, suppose I sample a word in one part of the graph, doesn't this information have to propagate to the other parts of the graph along the edges? Also, it's not clear to me how the model can achieve reasonable results on moving MNIST when it cannot distinguish the direction of the moving edges. The authors state this but do not provide satisfying insight into how this can work. How does a pixel know that it should turn on in the next frame? I wish the authors thought about this more and presented it more clearly.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,Detailed comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,1. Please provide more details on what is plotted in Figure 1. Is 1 (b) is the t-sne projection of representations learned by DANN or R-DANN? The text in section 4.4 suggests it’s the later case. It is surprising to see such a regular plot for VRADA.  What do you think are the two dominant latent factors encoded in figure 1 (c)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"2. In Table 2, the two baselines have quite significant difference in performance testing on the entire target (including validation set) vs on the test set only.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"After reading them, I still think the paper is not novel enough",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,so I'm leaving the rating untouched.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,This paper proposes a domain adaptation technique for time series.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,The core of the approach is a combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation (at the last time step).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,1. The authors consider a very important application of domain adaptation.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,2. The paper is well-written and relatively easy to read.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,3. Solid empirical evaluation. The authors compare their method against several recent domain adaptation techniques on a number of datasets.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,1. The novelty of the approach is relatively low: it’s just a straightforward fusion of the existing techniques.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,2. The paper lacks any motivation for use of the particular combination (VRNN and RevGrad). I still believe comparable results can be obtained by polishing R-DANN (e.g. carefully penalizing domain discrepancy at every step),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,Additional comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,1. I’m not convinced by the discussion presented in Section 4.4. I don’t think the visualization of firing patterns can be used to support the efficiency of the proposed method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"2. Figure 1(c) looks very suspicious. I can hardly believe t-SNE could produce this _very_ regular structure for non-degenerate (non-synthetic, real-world) data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"Overall, it’s a solid paper but I’m not sure if it is up to the ICLR standard.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,This paper combines variational RNN (VRNN) and domain adversarial networks (DANN) for domain adaptation in the sequence modelling domain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"The VRNN is used to learn representations for sequential data, which is the hidden states of the last time step.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"The DANN is used to make the representations domain invariant, therefore achieving cross domain adaptation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"Experiments are done on a number of data sets, and the proposed method (VRADA) outperforms baselines including DANN, VFAE and R-DANN on almost all of them.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"I don't have questions about the proposed model, the model is quite clear and seems to be a simple combination of VRNN and DANN.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,But a few questions came up during the pre-review question phase:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"As the authors have mentioned, DANN in general outperforms MMD based methods, however, the VFAE method which is based on MMD regularization on the representations seems to outperform DANN across the board.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,That seems to indicate VRNN + MMD should also be a good combination.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"One baseline the authors showed in the experiments is R-DANN, which is an RNN version of DANN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,"There are two differences between R-DANN and VRADA: (1) R-DANN uses deterministic RNN for representation learning, while VRADA uses variational RNN; (2) on target domain R-DANN only optimizes adversarial loss, while VRADA optimizes both adversarial loss and reconstruction loss for feature learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk9eAFcxg,It would be good to analyze further where the performance gain comes from.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"This paper applies convnet-based object detection techniques to detection of weather events from 3D climate data, additionally exploring the effect of using an unsupervised autoencoder-style objective term.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The benefits of the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning end up being a little underwhelming, with 52.92% mAP for the 3D+semi-sup result vs. 51.42% mAP for the 2D+sup result.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,perhaps there was not a thorough enough hyperparameter search for these cases.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The paper does acknowledge this and provide potential explanations in Sec. 4.3, however.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"As other reviewers pointed out, the use of the 0.1 IoU criterion for true positives is very loose relative to the standard 0.5 criterion.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"On the other hand, if the results visualized in Figure 3 are typical, a 0.1 overlap criterion could be reasonable for this domain as the detector does seem to localize events well enough that the system could be used to expedite human review of the climate images for extreme events.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,As such I am upgrading my rating from a 5 to a 6 and recommend acceptance of the paper.],0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The paper proposes to apply deep nets to perform detection and localization of extreme weather events in simulated weather data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The problem is related to object detection in computer vision in that the input is a 2D “image” (multichannel spatial weather data) or 3D “video” (temporal version of the data) and the output is a bounding box (spatial-temporal localization of a weather event) and class label (weather event type).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,It differs from standard object detection in that the input has multiple heterogenous channels and labeled data is scarce.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,A simple but quite reasonable deep net is proposed for the task based on similar approaches in computer vision.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,While proposal based systems are most popular in vision currently (in particular Faster-RCNN) the proposed approach is simple and a fine starting point.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"There is little innovation on the part of the detection system, but as noted, it is a valid application of ideas from computer vision to the task at hand.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The authors propose both a supervised approach (only ground truth bounding box location/label is used) and a semi-supervised approach that additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss as a regularization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"In all cases the losses are fairly standard and again, reasonable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The only confusing bit is that the “semi-supervised” loss actually has all the labels used for the “supervised” loss and additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Hence, the “semi-supervised” loss is actually stronger, which makes the terminology a bit confusing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The paper is easy to follow, but notation is sloppy.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"For example, above equation 5 it states that “the loss is a weighted combination of reconstruction error and bounding box regression loss”; actually it’s a combination of the supervised and unsupervised loss (Lsup and Lunsup), and Lrec is not defined (although I assume Lrec=Lunsup).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The paper is fairly non-technical, but nevertheless these minor issues should be fixed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"(E.g., see also reference to “figure 4 and 4”).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The biggest concern w the paper though is experimental results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Only a single figure and table of results are shown (figure 4 and table 4).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The metrics are not defined (what is mean average recall?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Only 2D versus 3D version of the model are shown, and supervised and semi-supervised.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Moreover, numbers seem a bit all over the place, without consistent patterns (e.g., why is 2D supervised better than the seemingly much strong 3D semi-supervised?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"One of the things that is unclear is how many events are actually in the training/testing data, and more importantly, how good are these results in absolute terms?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Regardless, the experiments are fairly sparse and ablation studies and more discussion lacking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,It is also unclear if future researchers will be able to reproduce the experimental setting (a commitment to open-source the data or a way to reproduce the experiments would be critical for future authors).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Minor nit: the authors use both a classification loss and an “objectness” loss. I’ve never seen both used together like this (normally objectness is used in two-stage object proposal systems where in the first stage class-agnostic proposals are given and in the second stage these are cropped and a class-specific classifier is applied). I strongly suspect removing the objectness loss would not impact results since the classification loss should provide strictly stronger supervisory signal. Regardless, this is a fairly non-standard choice and should be justified (experimentally).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Overall this is a borderline paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I do believe that it is valuable to apply computer vision techniques to a domain that I’ve see little work on in our community.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"That being said, I have no expertise on this type of data",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"it’s possible this deep learning techniques are now routinely used in the climate science literature (I suspect not, though).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Overall, there is little novelty on the algorithmic side in this paper (the equations in section 3 are commonly used in the cv literature).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The use of reconstruction loss to improve results in the data-sparse setting is interesting, but the experimental results are inconclusive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The experimental validation is generally insufficient.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Reproducibility for future research is difficult unless the data is open-sourced.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Overall, I think this paper is a good start, and with improved experiments and more careful writing I think could eventually make for a decent paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,This work presents a novel 3D CNN architecture for climate event detection that combines an unsupervised auto-encoder reconstruction loss with YOLO like bounding box prediction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"The approach is trained and evaluated on a large-scale, simulated climate dataset labeled by a costly heuristic approach called TECA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"For the most part, the paper is nicely written (minor comments below) and addresses an important and well motivated problem.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The authors provide sufficient model details to allow reproduction (although public code would be preferred).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I find the experiments a bit unconvincing (see below) but appreciate the attention to model capacity (via number of parameter) when comparing the 2D and 3D model variants.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I am concerned that the evaluation may be insufficient to assess the effectiveness of this method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,An IoU threshold of 0.1 allows for many rather poor detections to count as true positives.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"If the goal of this work is to count the number of such instances this is defensible, but for localization this seems overly loose.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Furthermore, the 3D CNN architecture (which is one of the the core novelties of this work compared to past efforts) does not seem capable of producing variable sized boxes (as noted in the last paragraph of page 7), which I imagine results in poorer performance at higher IoU thresholds (as many of the weather events appear small).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The experiments also feel inconclusive about the effect of temporal modeling and semi-supervision.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,The temporal component does not seem to matter in the supervised settings (2D 51.45 mAP - 3D 51.00 mAP) but improves somewhat in the semi-supervised case (2D 51.11 mAP - 3D 52.92 mAP).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Whereas the additional unlabeled data seems to hurt in the 2D case but improve results for the 3D model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Could the authors provide confidence intervals for these numbers?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"I would like to see further discussion of these trends especially with respect to the effect of the loss weights (alpha, beta, and gamma).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I also note that it is not clear if both the 2D and 3D models were trained for equivalent time periods (seems like no from last paragraph of page 7).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Could a plot of training and validation accuracy for each model be presented for comparison?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Finally, is there any baseline approach the authors could report or compare too?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"Without one, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of the approach with respect to the difficulty of the problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Preliminary Rating:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I think this is an interesting paper that is well motivated but feel the experiments as presented do not seem adequate to support any conclusive trends.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"I would like to see the mAP trends across a wider range of IoU values and further discussion of training procedure, loss weight settings, and reasons for lack of bounding box variability in the 3D model (as stated above).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Clarification:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,"In the paper you say ""While climate models are run on a 3D grid, with the vertical dimension corresponding to 30 levels; we only consider surface quantities (i.e. 2D data) in this study.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Could you elaborate on what the surface quantities correspond to?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Is it the highest cloud level?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,4.3 4th paragraph the word section is not capitalized like elsewhere.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,Edit: I appreciate the authors responding to my questions but still feel the relatively poor localization performance at stricter IoU thresholds fails to justify the complexity of the approach.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ_QCYqle,I encourage the authors to continue pursuing this line of research.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,One of the main idea of this paper is to replace pooling layers with convolutions of stride 2 and retraining the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,Authors merge this into a new layer and brand it as a new type of layer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,This is very misleading and adding noise to the field.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,And using strided convolutions rather than pooling is not actually novel (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02346).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,"While the speed-up obtained are good, the lack of novelty and the rebranding attempt make this paper not a good fit for ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,This paper proposes to reduce model size and evaluation time of deep CNN models on mobile devices by converting multiple layers into single layer and then retraining the converted model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,The paper showed that the computation time can be reduced by 3x to 5x with only 0.4% accuracy loss on a specific model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,Reducing model sizes and speeding up model evaluation are important in many applications.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,I have several concerns:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,"1. There are many techniques that can reduce model sizes. For example, it has been shown by several groups that using the teacher-student approach, people can achieve the same and sometimes even better accuracy than the teacher (big model) using a much smaller model. However, this paper does not compare any one of them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,2. The technique proposed in this paper is limited in its applicability since it's designed specifically for the models discussed in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,"3. Replacing several layers with single layer is a relatively standard procedure. For example, the mean variance normalization layer and batch normalization layer can all be absorbed without retraining or losing accuracy.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,Interesting set of experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,This paper needs a lot of improvements to be suitable for publication.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,Open-sourcing: having the implementation be open-source always enhances the usefulness of such paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkwSJ99ex,Not a requirement obviously.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,Overall the paper has the feel of a status update by some of the best researchers in the field.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"The paper is very clear, the observations are interesting, but the remarks are scattered and don't add up to a quantum of progress in the study of what can be done with the Neural GPU model.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"Minor remark on the use of the term RNN in Table 1: I found Table 1 confusing because several of the columns are for models that are technically RNNs, and use of RNNs for e.g. translation and word2vec highlight that RNNs can be characterized in terms of the length of their input sequence, the length of their input, and the sizes (per step) of their input, output, and working memories.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,Basic model question: How are inputs presented (each character 1-hot?) and outputs retrieved when there are e.g. 512 “filters” in the model ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"If inputs and outputs are 1-hot encoded, and treated with the same filters as intermediate layers, then the intermediate activation functions should be interpretable as digits, and we should be able to interpret the filters as implementing a reliable e.g. multiplication-with-carry algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,Looking at the intermediate values may shed some light on why the usually-working models fail on e.g. the pathological cases identified in Table 3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"The preliminary experiment on input alignment is interesting in two ways: the seeds for effective use of an attentional mechanism are there, but also, it suggests that the model is not presently dealing with general expression evaluation the way a correct algorithm should.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The remarks in the abstract about improving the memory efficiency of Neural GPU seem overblown,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"the paragraph at the top of page 6 describes the improvements as using tf.while_loop instead of unrolling the graph, and using swap_memory to use host memory when GPU memory runs short.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"These both seem like good practice, but not a remarkable improvement to the efficiency of the model, in fact it would likely slow down training and inference when memory does in fact fit in the GPU.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"The point about trying many of random seeds to get convergence makes me wonder if the Neural GPU is worth its computational cost at all, when evaluated as means of learning algorithms that are already well understood (e.g. parsing and evaluating S-exprs).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,Consider spending all of the computational cycles that go into training one of these models (with the multiple seeds) on a traditional search through program space (e.g. sampling lisp programs or something).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"The notes on the curriculum strategies employed to get the presented results were interesting to read, as an indication of the lengths to which someone might have to go to train this sort of model, but it does leave this reviewer with the impression that despite the stated extensions of the Neural GPU model it remains unclear how useful it might be to practical problems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The authors investigate the neural GPU model introduced by Kaiser and Sutskever.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,In section 3 they claim its performance is due to the O(n^2) number of steps it can perform for each example.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,In the subsequent section they highlight the importance of curriculum training and empirically show that larger models generalize better.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,In section 5 they construct examples that reveal failure modes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,In the last section they compare the performance given different input formats.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The paper is well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,It contains an exhaustive set of experiments which provide insight into the details of training the neural GPU model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,It pushes the boundary of algorithms that can be learned further.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"On the other hand, the paper seems to lack a coherent message.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,It also fails to provide any insight into the how and why of the observations made (i.e. why curriculum training is essential and why certain failure modes exist).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The introduction contains several statements which should be qualified or explained further.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,As far as I am aware statistical learning theory does not guarantee that empirical risk minimization is consistent when the number of parameters is larger than the number of examples; the generalization performance depends on the VC dimension of the function space instead.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"Furthermore, the suggested link between adversarial examples and learning algorithms is tenuous, and references or a further explanation should be provided for the contentious statement that deep neural networks are able to match the performance of any parallel machine learning algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"The authors argue that the neural GPU performs O(n^2) “steps” on each example, which allows it to learn algorithms with super-linear complexity such as multiplication.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,This analysis seems to overlook the parallel nature of the neural GPU architecture: Both addition and multiplication have O(log n) time complexity when parallelism is used (cf.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,a carry-lookahead adder and a Wallace tree respectively).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"In section 4 the authors show that their larger models generalize better, which they argue is not self-evident.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"However, since both training and test error decrease it is likely that the smaller models are underfitting, in which case it is not counter-intuitive at all that a larger model would have better generalization error.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"It is interesting to see that progressively decreasing the number of terms and increasing the radix of the number system works well as a learning curriculum, although it would be nice to have a stronger intuitive or theoretical justification for the latter.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The final section claims that neural GPUs are cellular automata.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"Further justification for this statement would be useful, since cellular automata are discrete models, and the equivalence between both models is in no way obvious.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,The relationship between global operations and changing the input format is circuitous.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryjp1c9xg,"In conclusion, the paper provides some useful insights into the neural GPU model, but does not introduce original extensions to the model and does not explain any fundamental limitations.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,The approach in the paper is not specific to transferring from logical rules (as stated in the Sec 2) and is simply relying on the rule engine to provide labels for unlabelled data.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,One of the obvious baselines to compare with your approach is standard multi-task learning on both tasks A and B together.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"That is, you train the model from scratch on both tasks simultaneously (which sharing parameters).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"The writing of the paper in general needs some improvement, but more specifically in the experiment section, where experiment setting and baselines should be explained more concisely.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"Table 1 seems like reporting cross-validation results, and I do not think is very informative to general reader.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,This paper proposes a regularization technique for neural network training that relies on having multiple related tasks or datasets in a transfer learning setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,The proposed technique is straightforward to describe and can also leverage external labeling systems perhaps based on logical rules.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,The paper is clearly written and the experiments seem relatively thorough.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,Overall this is a nice paper but does not fully address how robust the proposed technique is.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"I can’t figure out if this is because the proposed technique does not work well in general and thus required a lot of fiddling to get right in experiments, or if this is simply an artifact of ad-hoc experiments to try and get the best performance overall.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"However in the details of logical rule distillation and various experiment settings it seems like there is a lot of running the model many times or selecting a particular way of reusing the models and data that makes me wonder how robust the technique is or whether it requires a lot of trying various approaches, ensembling, or picking the best model from cross validation to show real gains.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,The authors could help by discussing this explicitly for all experiments in one place rather than listing the various choices / approaches in each experiment.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,Section 7 introduces the logical rules engine in a fairly specific context.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,Rather it would be good state more generally what this system entails to help people figure out how this method would apply to other problems.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,This paper introduces a new method for transfer learning that avoids the catastrophic forgetting problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,It also describes an ensembling strategy for combining models that were learned using transfer learning from different sources.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyenWc5gx,"It puts all of this together in the context of recurrent neural networks for text analytics problems, to achieve new state-of-the-art results for a subtask of the SemEval 2016 competition.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,The number of the experiments are good.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,"But I am not sure I am convinced by the numbers in Table 1 since the patterns are not very clear there — sometimes, the performance of the higher level tasks even goes down when training with more tasks (sometimes it does go up, but also not very significant and stable).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,"The dependency scores, although I don’t think this is a serious problem, comparing the UAS/LAS when the output is not guaranteed to be a well-formed tree isn’t strictly speaking fair.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,I admit that the successive regularization make sense intuitively and is a very interesting direction to try.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,"However, without a careful study of the training schema of such model, the current results on successive regularization do not convince me that it should be the right thing to do in such models (the current results are not strong enough to show that).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJZAb5cel,"The training methods need to be explored here including things as iteratively train on different tasks, and the relationship between the number of training iterations of a task and it’s training set size (and loss on this task etc).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,Here the adversarial training is used to extract a novice-expert (or third-person/first-person) independent feature so that the agent can use to perform the same policy in a different view point.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"While the idea is quite elegant and novel (I enjoy reading it), more experiments are needed to justify the approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Probably the most important issue is that there is no baseline, e.g., what if we train the model with the image from the same viewpoint?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Another important question is that maybe the network just blindly remembers the policy, in this case, the extracted feature could be artifacts of the input image that implicitly counts the time tick in some way (and thus domain-agonistic), but can still perform reasonable policy.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"For the experiments, Fig.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"4,5,6 does not have error bars and is not very convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The paper presents an interesting new problem setup for imitation learning: an agent tries to imitate a trajectory demonstrated by an expert but said trajectory is demonstrated in a different state or observation space than the one accessible by the agent (although the dynamics of the underlying MDP are shared).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The paper proposes a solution strategy that combines recent work on domain confusion losses with a recent IRL method based on generative adversarial networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,I believe the general problem to be relevant and agree with the authors that it results in a more natural formulation for imitation learning that might be more widely applicable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,There are however a few issues with the paper in its current state that make the paper fall short of being a great exploration of a novel idea.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,I will list these concerns in the following (in arbitrary order),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"The paper feels at times to be a bit hurriedly written (this also mainly manifests itself in the experiments, see comment below) and makes a few fairly strong claims in the introduction that in my opinion are not backed up by their approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"For example: ""Advancements in this class of algorithms would significantly improve the state of robotics, because it will enable anyone to easily teach robots new skills""; given that the current method to my understanding has the same issues that come with standard GAN training (e.g. instability etc.) and requires a very accurate simulator to work well (since TRPO will require a large number of simulated trajectories in each step) this seems like an overstatement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"There are some sentences that are ungrammatical or switch tense in the middle of the sentence making the paper harder to read than necessary, e.g. Page 2: ""we find that this simple approach has been able to solve the problems""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"The general idea of third person imitation learning is nice, clear and (at least to my understanding) also novel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"However, instead of exploring how to generally adapt current IRL algorithms to this setting the authors pick a specific approach that they find promising (using GANs for IRL) and extend it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,A significant amount of time is then spent on explaining why current IRL algorithms will fail in the third-person setting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,I fail to see why the situation for the GAN based approach is any different than that of any other existing IRL algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,To be more clear: I see no reason why e.g. behavioral cloning could not be extended with a domain confusion loss in exactly the same way as the approach presented.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,To this end it would have been nice to rather discuss which algorithms can be adapted in the same way (and also test them) and which ones cannot.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"One straightforward approach to apply any IRL algorithm would for example be to train two autoencoders for both domains that share higher layers + a domain confusion loss on the highest layer, should that not result in features that are directly usable?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"If not, why?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,While the general argument that existing IRL algorithms will fail in the proposed setting seems reasonable it is still unfortunate that no attempts have been made to validate this empirically.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,No comparison is made regarding what happens when one e.g. performs supervised learning (behavioral cloning) using the expert observations and then transfers to the changed domain.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,How well would this work in practice ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Also, how fast can different IRL algorithms solve the target task in general (assuming a first person perspective) ?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,Although I like the idea of presenting the experiments as being directed towards answering a specific set of questions I feel like the posed questions somewhat distract from the main theme of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Question 2 suddenly makes the use of additional velocity information to be a main point of importance and the experiments regarding Question 3 in the end only contain evaluations regarding two hyperparameters (ignoring all other parameters such as the parameters for TRPO, the number of rollouts per iteration, the number of presented expert episodes and  the design choices for the GAN).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,I understand that not all of these can be evaluated thoroughly in a conference paper but I feel like some more experiments or at least some discussion would have helped here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The presented experimental evaluation somewhat hides the cost of TRPO training with the obtained reward function.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,How many roll-outs are necessary in each step?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The experiments lack some details: How are the expert trajectories obtained?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"The domains for the pendulum experiment seem identical except for coloring of the pole, is that correct (I am surprised this small change seems to have such a detrimental effect)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Figure 3 shows average performance over 5 trials, what about Figure 5 (if this is also average performance, what is the variance here)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Given that GANs are not easy to train, how often does the training fail/were you able to re-use the hyperparameters across all experiments?",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,Please see my response to the rebuttal below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The paper extends the imitation learning paradigm to the case where the demonstrator and learner have different points of view.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"This is an important contribution, with several good applications.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,The main insight is to use adversarial training to learn a policy that is robust to this difference in perspective.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"The basic approach is clearly explained, and follows quite readily from recent literature on imitation learning and adversarial training.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"Reinforcement learning using agent A data, and apply the policy on agent A.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,I expect this might do better than 3rd person imitation learning,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,but it might depend on the scenario (e.g. difficulty of imitation vs exploration; how different are the points of view between the agents).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B16dGcqlx,"I understand this is how the expert data is collected for the demonstrator, but I don’t see the performance results from just using this procedure on the learner (to compare to Fig.3 results).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,"Update: After reading the rebuttal comments and the revised paper, I'm leaving the rating as it was before.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,This paper proposes an unsupervised algorithm for transferring samples from one domain to another (related) domain under the constraint that some predefined f returns same result for the input and the result.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,1. The paper presents an interesting idea of comparing samples from different domains using a fixed perceptual function f.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,2. The proposed method produces visually appealing results on several datasets,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,3. The authors demonstrate how their approach can be used for domain adaptation and obtain improved results on the SVHN->MNIST task,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,4. The paper is well-written and easy to read,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,1. The novelty of the method is relatively minor (I consider f-constancy term as the main contribution),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,2. It feels like the proposed approach would break for more dissimilar domains. The method relies on a fixed f which is trained on the source domain. This f can potentially drop information important for obtaining 1) better reconstructions in the target domain  2) more tightly related x and g(f(x)). I think the authors should consider either training all the modules in the model end-to-end or incorporating target samples into the training of f.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,3. A single domain adaptation experiment is definitely not enough to consider the proposed method as a universal alternative to the existing DA approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,I would also like to point out that using super-resolved outputs as opposed to the actual model’s outputs can produce a false impression of the visual quality of the transferred samples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk2Im59ex,I’d suggest moving original outputs from the appendix into the main part.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"The authors present a simple method to affix a cache to neural language models, which provides in effect a copying mechanism from recently used words.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"Unlike much related work in neural networks with copying mechanisms, this mechanism need not be trained with long-term backpropagation, which makes it efficient and scalable to much larger cache sizes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,They demonstrate good improvements on language modeling by adding this cache to RNN baselines.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,The main contribution of this paper is the observation that simply using the hidden states h_i,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"as keys for words x_i, and h_t as the query vector, naturally gives a lookup mechanism that works fine without tuning by backprop.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"This is a simple observation and might already exist as folk knowledge among some people, but it has nice implications for scalability and the experiments are convincing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"The basic idea of repurposing locally-learned representations for large-scale attention where backprop would normally be prohibitively expensive is an interesting one, and could probably be used to improve other types of memory networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,My main criticism of this work is its simplicity and incrementality when compared to previously existing literature.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"As a simple modification of existing NLP models, but with good empirical success, simplicity and practicality, it is probably more suitable for an NLP-specific conference.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"However, since the technical contribution is rather limited, the experiments need to be more thorough and conclusive.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"While it is obvious from the results that adding a cache component improves over language models without memory, it is still unclear that this is the best way to do it (instead of, e.g., using pointer networks).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"A side-by-side comparison of models with pointer networks vs. models with cache with roughly the same number of parameters is needed to convincingly argue that the proposed method is a better alternative (either because it achieves lower perplexity, faster to train but similar test perplexity, faster at test time, etc.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,Some questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"In the experiment results, for your neural cache model, are those results with linear interpolation or global normalization, or the best model?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,Can you show results for both?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,Please also show accuracy on this dataset.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,It is also interesting that the authors mentioned that training the cache component instead of only using it at test time gives little improvements.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,Are the results about the same or worse?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"This paper not only shows that a cache model on top of a pre-trained RNN can improve language modeling, but also illustrates a shortcoming of standard RNN models in that they are unable to capture this information themselves.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B184E5qee,"Regardless of whether this is due to the small BPTT window (35 is standard) or an issue with the capability of the RNN itself, this is a useful insight.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,This paper examines computational creativity from a machine learning perspective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,Creativity is defined as a model's ability to generate new types of objects unseen during training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The authors argue that likelihood training and evaluation are by construction ill-suited for out-of-class generation and propose a new evaluation framework which relies on the use of held-out classes of objects to measure a model's ability to generate new and interesting object types.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"I am not very familiar with the literature on computational creativity research, so I can't judge on how well this work has been put into the context of existing work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"From a machine learning perspective, I find the ideas presented in this paper new, interesting and thought-provoking.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"As I understand, the hypothesis is that the ability of a model to generate new and interesting types we *do not* know about correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types we *do* know about, and the latter is a good proxy for the former.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The extent to which this is true depends on the bias introduced by model selection.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"Just like when measuring generalization performance, one should be careful not to reuse the same held-out classes for model selection and for evaluation.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,- The ordering of the exposition is also frustrating. I found myself constantly having to refer ahead to figures and back to details that were important but seemingly presented out of order. Perhaps a reordering of some details could fix this.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The good:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,What the paper does well is to gather together past work on novelty generation and propose a unified framework in which to evaluate past and future models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,This is done by repurposing existing generative model evaluation metrics for the task of evaluating novelty.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"The experiments are basic, but even the basic experiments go beyond previous work in this area (to this reviewer’s knowledge).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"As with other novelty papers, it would be read thoroughly by the interested few, but it is likely to fight an uphill battle against the majority of readers outside the sub-sub-field of novelty generation; for this reason the theory should be made even more intuitive and clear and the experiments and results even more accessible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The authors proposed an way to measure the generation of out-of-distribution novelty.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"Their methods implied, if a model trained on MNIST digits could generate some samples are more like letters judged by anther model trained both on MNIST and letters,  the model trained on MNIST could be seen as having  the ability to generate novel samples.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,A naive combination of MNIST and letters dataset do not represent the natural distribution of handwritten digits and letters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,IT means that the model trained on the combination could not properly distinguished digits and letters.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The proposed out-of-class count and out-of-class max are thus pointless.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"For the ""novel"" samples in Fig. 3,  they are clearly digits.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"If they would quantize the samples to 8 bit, the resulting images would look even more like digits.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,This paper proposed a quantitative metric for evaluating out-of-class novelty of samples from generative models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,The authors evaluated the proposed metric on over 1000 models with different hyperparameters and performed human subject study on a subset of them.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,"The authors mentioned difficulties in human subject studies, but did not provide details of their own setting.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByEPMj5el,I'm worried about the diversity in the subjects because there may be too few subjects who are shown too many samples and/or are experts in this field.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"The problem of utilizing all available information (across modalities) about a product to learn a meaningful ""joint"" embedding is an interesting one, and certainly seems like it a promising direction for improving recommender systems, especially in the ""cold start"" scenario.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"I'm unaware of approaches combining as many modalities as proposed in this paper, so an effective solution could indeed be significant.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"However, there are many aspects of the proposed architecture that seem sub-optimal to me:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"1. A major benefit of neural-network based systems is that the entire system can be trained end-to-end, jointly. The proposed approach sticks together largely pre-trained modules for different modalities... this can be justifiable when there is very little training data available on which to train jointly. With 10M product pairs, however, this doesn't seem to be the case for the Amazon dataset (although I haven't worked with this dataset myself so perhaps I'm missing something... either way it's not discussed at all in the paper). I consider the lack of a jointly fine-tuned model a major shortcoming of the proposed approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"2. The discussion of ""pairwise residual units"" is confusing and not well-motivated. The residual formulation (if I understand it correctly) applies a ReLU layer to the concatenation of the modality specific embeddings, giving a new similarity (after dot products) that can be added to the similarity obtained from the concatenation directly. Why not just have an additional fully-connected layer that mixes the modality specific embeddings to form a final embedding (perhaps of lower dimensionality)? This should at least be presented as a baseline, if the pairwise residual unit is claimed as a contribution... I don't find the provided explanation convincing (in what way does the residual approach reduce parameter count?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"3. More minor: The choice of TextCNN for the text embedding vectors seems fine (although I wonder how an LSTM-based approach would perform)... However the details surrounding how it is used are obscured in the paper. In response to a question, the authors mention that it runs on the concatenation of the first 10 words of the title and product description. Especially for the description, this seems insufficiently long to contain a lot of information to me.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,The paper should clearly motivate and show how different modalities contribute to the final task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,2) The connection between the proposed joint product embedding and residual networks is a bit awkward.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"The original residual layers are composed of adding the original input vector to the output of an MLP, i.e. several affine transformations followed by non-linearities.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,These layers allow training very deep neural networks (up to 1000 layers) as a result of easier gradient flow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"In contrast, the pairwise residual unit of this paper adds the dot product of two item vectors to the dot product of the same vectors but after applying a simple non-linearity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"The motivation of this architecture is not very obvious, and is not well motivated in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryTYxh5ll,"3) While it is a minor point, but the choice of the term embedding for the dot product of two items is not usual.",0

The authors also give discussions and explanations about the contradictories, which provides a good insight of the disadvantages and advantages between these two kind of networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skn9Shcxe,The main cons of the paper is that the experiments are not sufficient.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skn9Shcxe,"For example, since the main contribution of the paper is to propose the “unrolled iterative estimation"" and the stage 4 of Figure 3 seems not follow the assumption of ""unrolled iterative estimation"" and the authors says: ""We note that stage four (with three blocks) appears to be underestimating the representation values, indicating a probable weak link in the architecture."".",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJKkY35le,both the geometric regularizer and model regularizer has been proposed in the context of VAEs and the way they are used is essentially the same as this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJKkY35le,"I understand the argument of the authors that the VAEGAN is a VAE that is regularized by GAN and in this paper the main generative model is a GAN that is regularized by an autoencoder, but at the end of the day, both the models are combining the autoencoder and GAN in a pretty much same way, and to me the resulting model is not very different.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJKkY35le,"I also understand the other argument of the authors that Larsen et al is using VAE while this paper is using an autoencoder, but I am still not convinced how this paper outperforms the VAEGAN by just removing the KL term of the VAE.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJKkY35le,The second problem is that GANs are prone to missing modes of the data generating distribution entirely.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Updated review: the authors did an admirable job of responding to and incorporating reviewer feedback.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"In particular, they put a lot of effort into additional experiments, even incorporating a new and much stronger baseline (the ConvNet -> LSTM baseline requested by multiple reviewers).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,I still have two lingering concerns previously stated,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"that each model's architecture (# hidden units, etc.) should be tuned independently and that a pure time series forecasting baselines (without the trend preprocessing) should be tried.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,I'm going to bump up my score from a clear rejection to a borderline.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,This paper is concerned with time series prediction problems for which the prediction targets include the slope and duration of upcoming local trends.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"This setting is of great interest in several real world problem settings (e.g., financial markets) where decisions (e.g., buy or sell) are often driven by local changes and trends.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The primary challenge in these problems is distinguishing true changes and trends (i.e., a downturn in share price) from noise.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The authors tackle this with an interesting hybrid architecture (TreNet) with four parts: (1) preprocessing to extract trends, (2) an LSTM that accepts those trends as inputs to ostensibly capture long term dependencies, (3) a ConvNet that accepts a local window of raw data as its input at each time step, and (4) a higher ""feature fusion"" (i.e., dense) layer to combine the LSTM's and ConvNet's outputs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"On three univariate time series data sets, the TreNet outperforms the competing baselines including those based on its constituent parts (LSTM + trend inputs, CNN).",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Although this is an interesting problem setting (decisions driven by trends and changes), the authors did not make a strong argument for why they formulated the machine learning task as they did.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Thus, one could just easily formulate this as plain time series forecasting problem in which we forecast the next 100 steps and then apply the trend extractor to convert those predictions into a trend.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The proposed architecture, while interesting, is not justified, in particular the choice to feed the extracted trends and raw data into separate LSTM and ConvNet layers that are only combined at the end by a shallow MLP.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"An equally straightforward but more intuitive choice would have been to feed the output of the ConvNet into the LSTM, perhaps augmented by the trend input.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Following up on that point, the raw->ConvNet->LSTM and {raw->ConvNet,trends}->LSTM architectures are natural baselines for experiments.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,1) Summary,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,This paper proposes an end-to-end hybrid architecture to predict the local linear trends of time series.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,A temporal convnet on raw data extracts short-term features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"In parallel, long term representations are learned via a LSTM on piecewise linear approximations of the time series.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Both representations are combined using a MLP with one hidden layer (in two parts, one for each stream), and the entire architecture is trained end-to-end by minimizing (using Adam) the (l2-regularized) euclidean loss w.r.t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,ground truth local trend durations and slopes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,2) Contributions,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,+ Interesting end-to-end architecture decoupling short-term and long-term representation learning in two separate streams in the first part of the architecture.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Comparison to deep and shallow baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,3) Suggestions for improvement,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Add a LRCN baseline and discussion:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The benefits of decoupling short-term and long-term representation learning need to be assessed by comparing to the popular ""long-term recurrent convolutional network"" (LRCN) of Donahue et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4389).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,This approach stacks a LSTM on top of CNN features and is typically used on time series of video frames for tasks that are more general than local linear trend prediction.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Furthermore, LRCN does not require the hand-crafted preprocessing of time series to extract piecewise linear approximations needed by the LSTM of the TreNet architecture proposed here.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Finally, LRCN might be more parameter efficient, as it does not have the fully connected fusion layers of TreNet (eq. 8).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Add more complex multivariate datasets:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The currently used 3 datasets are limited, especially compared to modern research in representation learning for time series forecasting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"For instance, and of particular interest to ICLR, I would suggest investigating future frame prediction on natural video datasets like UCF101 where CNN+LSTM are typically used albeit with a more complex loss (cf. for instance the popular adversarial one of Mathieu et al).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Although different from the task of local linear trend prediction, it would be interesting to see how TreNet could be applied to the encoder stage of existing encoder-decoder architectures for frame prediction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"It seems that decoupling short term and long term motion representation learning (for instance) could be beneficial in natural videos, as they often contain fast object motions together with slower camera ones.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Clarification about the target variables:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,The authors need to clarify whether they handle separately or jointly the duration and slope.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"The text is ambiguous and seems to suggest training two separate models, one for slope, one for duration, which is particularly puzzling considering that predicting them jointly is in fact much easier (just two output variables instead of one), makes more sense, and is entirely feasible with the current method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Other parts of the text can be improved too.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"For instance, the authors can vastly compress the generic description of standard convnet and LSTM equations in section 4, while the preprocessing of the time series needs to appear much earlier.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,4) Conclusion,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"Although the architecture seems promising, the current experiments are too preliminary to validate its usefulness, in particular to existing alternatives like LRCN, which are not compared to.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,Revision of the review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,The authors did a commendable job of including additional references and baseline experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"This paper presents a hybrid architecture for time series prediction, focusing on the slope and duration of linear trends.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,The architecture consists of combining a 1D convnet for local time series and an LSTM for time series of trend descriptors.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,The convnet and LSTM features are combined into an MLP for predicting either the slope or the duration of the next trend in a 1D time series.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryCcJaqgl,"* In general, time series prediction for such applications as trading and load forecasting is pointless if no decision is made.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,The selection of only FC7 is a bit controversial - it is followed only by a single classification layer (FC8) to the common output - class likelyhoods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,"Because the FC8 is just a linear projections, what the equivalence map does is just to re-project the FC8 weights of the attached network to the weights of the original network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,Probably performing similar experiments but on more layers may be more useful (as the networks are already trained).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,The experiment with representation distance is missing what is the classification error on the testing dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,This would answer whether the representations are actually compatible up to linear transformation at all...,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,After training the equivalence map?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,More clear would be to show that networks trained on similar group of jitter transformations are more compatible on the target task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,*,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,There are also few minor issues:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,* It is not experimentally verified that the new criterion for equivariance mapping helps to gain better results.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,The angles on page 1 and 5 are missing units (degrees?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,"* On page three, ""In practice, it is difficult... "", it is not M_g which is maximised/minimised, but the loss over the M_g",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,"* Page 4, footnote 2 - if you are just halving the activations, it is hard to call it a dropout as this constant factor can be passed to the following/preceding weights",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,* Is the network for RVL-CDIP the same architecture as Alexnet?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syfkm6cgx,"* On page 7, Figure 3a+3b - in my opinion, turning the diagonal elements to white is really misleading, and probably even incorrect, as the distance between the same representations should be zero (which is also a way how to verify that the experiments are performed correctly).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"This paper proposes a method that attempts to ""understand"" what is happening within a neural network by using linear classifier probes which are inserted at various levels of the network.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"I think the idea is nice overall because it allows network designers to better understand the representational power of each layer in the network, but at the same time, this works feels a bit rushed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"In particular, the fact that the authors did not provide any results in ""real"" networks, which are used to win competitions makes the results less strong, since researchers who want to created competitive network architectures don't have enough evidence from this work to decides whether they should use it or not.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"Unfortunately, as is, I don't think we have enough novelty to justify accepting this work in the conference.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,This paper proposes to use a linear classifier as the probe for the informativeness of the hidden activations from different neural network layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The training of the linear classifier does not affect the training of the neural network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The paper is well motivated for investigating how much useful information (or how good the representations are) for each layer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"The observations in this paper agrees with existing insights, such as, 1) (Fig 5a) too many random layers are harmful.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"However, this paper has following problems:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,1. It is not sufficiently justified why the linear classifier is a good probe. It is not crystal clear why good intermediate features need to show high linear classification accuracy. More theoretical analysis and/or intuition will be helpful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,2. This paper does not provide much insight on how to design better networks based on the observations. Designing a better network is also the best way to justify the usefulness of the analysis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"Overall, this paper is tackling an interesting problem, but the technique (the linear classifier as the probe) is not novel and more importantly need to be better justified.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"Moreover, it is important to show how to design better neural networks using the observations in this paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The authors propose a method to investigate the predictiveness of intermediate layer activations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"To do so, they propose training linear classifiers and evaluate the error on the test set.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The paper is well motivated and aims to shed some light onto the progress of model training and hopes to provide insights into deep learning architecture design.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The two main reasons for why the authors decided to use linear probes seem to be:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,convexity,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,The last layer in the network is (usually) linear,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,In the second to last paragraph of page 4 the authors point out that it could happen that the intermediate features are useless for a linear classifier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,This is correct and what I consider the main flaw of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,I am missing any motivation as to the usefulness of the suggested analysis to architecture design.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"In fact, the example with the skip connection (Figure 8) seems to suggest that skip connections shouldn't be used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,Doesn't that contradict the recent successes of ResNet?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryF7rTqgl,"While the results are interesting, they aren't particularly surprising and I am failing to see direct applicability to understanding deep models as the authors suggest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,The paper proposes modification to seq2seq model to help it handle the problems when long responses are needed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"Though the technical contributions may be of value, the work in my personal opinion is not in the right direction towards helping dialog systems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"Essentially we try to generate long responses that sound ``nice"" yet are not grounded to any reality, they just need to be related to the question and not suffers from obvious mistakes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"Yet, the architectural innovations proposed may be of merit.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,The paper is clearly interesting in that it does address important problems (length and diversity of responses) in sequence-to-sequence models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,The two ideas put forward (glimpse model and segment-based stochastic decoding) both seem ideas in the right direction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,I was however not so sold on the argument that these are particularly suitable for conversations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,The results indicate that the ideas do indeed generate longer and also somewhat more sensible target sequences and as such the paper makes progress w.r.t these important problems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"So overall I would suggest accepting the paper even though the flavor of the proposed ideas are somewhat ""small steps"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,This paper considers the problem of generating long and diverse responses in dialog systems.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"Two techniques are proposed to the seq-to-seq framework: (1) glimpse model that trains on fixed-length segments of the target side at a time, and (2) a segment-based stochastic decoding technique which injects diversity earlier in the generated responses.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,The large scale experiments on 2.3B conversation messages are quite impressive.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,Experiments on human evaluation should also be encouraged.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"With all these said, I am still not 100% convinced that machine generated long sequence is the right direction for dialog systems.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,"As shown in Figure 3 (a), human evaluation shows that the proposed system is not significantly better than the baselines.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJDdiT9gl,I think more analysis and user preference mining should be done in the future to help us understand the nature of this problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,It is refreshing that OpenAI has taken the time to resurrect classic heuristics like down-sampling and dropout into PixelCNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,Some sort of AR technique like PixelCNN probably holds the missing keys needed to eventually have decent originally-created images from CIFAR10 or other real-life data-sets.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"So any engineering streamlining, as in this paper, is welcome to the general public, especially when helping to avoid expensive clusters of GPUs, only DeepMind can afford.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"In this sense, OpenAI is fulfilling its mission and we are all very grateful!",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,Thus the paper is a welcome addition and we hope it finds its way into what appears to be an experimental CS conference anyway.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"On a more conceptual level, our hope is that OpenAI, with so talented a team, will stop competing in these contrived contests to improve by basis points certain obscure log-likelihoods and instead focus on the bigger picture problems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Why for example, almost two years later, the class-conditional CIFAR10 samples, as on the left of Figure 4 in this paper (column 8 - class of horses), are still inferior to, say, the samples on Figure 4 of reference [2]?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Forgive the pun, but aren't we beating a dead horse here?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Yes, resolution and sharpness have improved, due to good engineering but nobody in the general public will take these samples seriously!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Despite the claims put forward by some on the DeepMind team, PixelCNN is not a ""fully-generative"" neural net (as rigorously defined in section 3 of reference",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This submission proposes an improved implementation of the PixelCNN generative model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Most of the improvements are small and can be considered as specific technical details such as the use of dropout and skip connections, while others are slightly more substantial such as the use of a different likelihood model and multiscale analysis.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The submission demonstrates state-of-the-art likelihood results on CIFAR-10.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,My summary of the main contribution:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,Autoregressive-type models - of which PixelCNN is an example - are a nice class of models as their likelihood can be evaluated in closed form.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,A main differentiator for this type of models is how the conditional likelihood of one pixel conditioned on its causal neighbourhood is modelled:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"In one line of work such as (Theis et al, 2012 MCGSM, Theis et al 2015 Spatial LSTM)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,the conditional distribution is modelled as a continuous density over real numbers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This approach has limitations: We know that in observed data pixel intensities are quantized to a discrete integer representation so a discrete distribution could give better likelihoods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Furthermore these continuous distributions have a tail and assign some probability mass outside the valid range of pixel intensities, which may hurt the likelihood.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,In more recent work by van den Oord and colleagues the conditional likelihood is modelled as an arbitrary discrete distribution over the 256 possible values for pixel intensities.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"This does not suffer from the limitations of continuous likelihoods, but it also seems wasteful and is not very data efficient.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"The authors propose something in the middle by keeping the discretized nature of the conditional likelihood, but restricting the discrete distribution to ones whose CDF that can be modeled as a linear combination of sigmoids.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"This approach makes sense to me, and is new in a way, but it doesn’t appear to be very revolutionary or significant to me.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The second somewhat significant modification is the use of downsampling and multiscale modelling (as opposed to dilated convolutions).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The main motivation for the authors to do this is saving computation time while keeping the multiscale flexibility of the model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors also introduce shortcut connections to compensate for the potential loss of information as they perform downsampling.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Again, I feel that this modification not particularly revolutionary.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Multiscale image analysis with autoregressive generative models has been done for example in (Theis et al, 2012) and several other papers.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Overall I felt that this submission falls short on presenting substantially new ideas, and reads more like documentation for a particular implementation of an existing idea.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,# Review,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"This paper proposes five modifications to improve PixelCNN, a generative model with tractable likelihood.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors empirically showed the impact of each of their proposed modifications using a series of ablation experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,They also reported a new state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Improving generative models, especially for images, is an active research area and this paper definitely contributes to it.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,# Pros,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors motivate each modification well they proposed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,They also used ablation experiments to show each of them is important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors use a discretized mixture of logistic distributions to model the conditional distribution of a sub-pixel instead of a 256-way softmax.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This allows to have a lower output dimension and to be better suited at learning ordinal relationships between sub-pixel values.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors also mentioned it speeded up training time (less computation) as well as the convergence during the optimization of the model (as shown in Fig.6).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors make an interesting remark about how the dependencies between the color channels of a pixel are likely to be relatively simple and do not require a deep network to model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This allows them to have a simplified architecture where you don't have to separate out all feature maps in 3 groups depending on whether or not they can see the R/G/B sub-pixel of the current location.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,# Cons,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,It is not clear to me what the predictive distribution for the green channel (and the blue) looks like.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"More precisely, how are the means of the mixture components linearly depending on the value of the red sub-pixel?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,I would have liked to see the equations for them.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This paper on autoregressive generative models explores various extensions of PixelCNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"The proposed changes are to replace the softmax function with a logistic mixture model, to use dropout for regularization, to use downsampling to increase receptive field size, and the introduction of particular skip connections.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"The authors find that this allows the PixelCNN to outperform a PixelRNN on CIFAR-10, the previous state-of-the-art model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The authors further explore the performance of PixelCNNs with smaller receptive field sizes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,Review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,This is a useful contribution towards better tractable image models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"In particular, autoregressive models can be quite slow at test time, and the more efficient architectures described here should help with that.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,My main criticism regards the severe neglect of related work.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Mixture models have been used a lot in autoregressive image modeling, including for multivariate conditional densities and including downsampling to increase receptive field size, albeit in a different manner:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Domke (2008), Hosseini et al. (2010), Theis et al. (2012), Uria et al. (2013), Theis et al. (2015).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Note that the logistic distribution is a special case of the Gaussian scale mixture (West, 1978).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,The main difference seems to be the integration of the density to model integers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"While this is clearly a good idea and the right way forward, the authors claim but do not support that not doing this has “proved to be a problem for earlier models based on continuous distributions”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Please elaborate, add a reference, or ideally report the performance achieved by PixelCNN++ without integration (and instead adding uniform noise to make the variables continuous).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"60,000 images are not a lot in a high-dimensional space.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,While I can see the usefulness of regularization for specialized content – and this can serve as a good example to demonstrate the usefulness of dropout – why not use “80 million tiny images” (superset of CIFAR-10) for natural images?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"Semi-supervised learning should be fairly trivial here (because the model’s likelihood is tractable), so this data could even be used in the class-conditional case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJrFC6ceg,"It would be interesting to know how fast the different models are at test time (i.e., when generating images).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,This paper presents an information theoretic framework for unsupervised learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"The framework relies on infomax principle, whose goal is to maximize the mutual information between input and output.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,The authors propose a two-step algorithm for learning in this setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"First, by leveraging an asymptotic approximation to the mutual information, the global objective is decoupled into two subgoals whose solutions can be expressed in closed form.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"Next, these serve as the initial guess for the global solution, and are refined by the gradient descent algorithm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"While the story of the paper and the derivations seem sound, the clarity and presentation of the material could improve.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"For example, instead of listing step by step derivation of each equation, it would be nice to first give a high-level presentation of the result and maybe explain briefly the derivation strategy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"The very detailed aspects of derivations, which could obscure the underlying message of the result could perhaps be postponed to later sections or even moved to an appendix.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,A few questions that the authors may want to clarify:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"1. Page 4, last paragraph: ""from above we know that maximizing I(X;R) will result in maximizing I(Y;R) and I(X,Y^U)"". While I see the former holds due to equality in 2.20, the latter is related via a bound in 2.21. Due to the possible gap between I(X;R) and I(X,Y^U), can your claim that maximizing of the former indeed maximizes the latter be true?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"2. Paragraph above section 2.2.2: it is stated that, dropout used to prevent overfitting may in fact be regarded as an attempt to reduce the rank of the weight matrix. No further tip is provided why this should be the case. Could you elaborate on that?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"3. At the end of page 9: ""we will discuss how to get optimal solution of C for two specific cases"". If I understand correctly, you actually are not guaranteed to get the optimal solution of C in either case, and the best you can guarantee is reaching a local optimum. This is due to the nonconvexity of the constraint 2.80 (quadratic equality). If optimality cannot be guaranteed, please correct the wording accordingly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,This paper proposes a hierarchical infomax method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,My comments are as follows:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"(1) First of all, this paper is 21 pages without appendix, and too long as a conference proceeding.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"Therefore, it is not easy for readers to follow the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,The authors should make this paper as compact as possible while maintaining the important message.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,(2) One of the main contribution in this paper is to find a good initialization point by maximizing I(X;R).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"However, it is unclear why maximizing I(X;\breve{Y}) is good for maximizing I(X;R) because Proposition 2.1 shows that I(X;\breve{Y}) is an “upper” bound of I(X;R)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"(When it is difficult to directly maximize a function, people often maximize some tractable “lower” bound of it).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"(1) If (2.11) is approximation of (2.8), “\approx” should be used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,(2) Why K_1 instead of N in Eq.(2.11)?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"(3) In Eq.(2.12), H(X) should disappear?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,(4) Can you divide Section 3 into subsections?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,This is an 18 page paper plus appendix which presents a mathematical derivation for infomax for an actual neural population with noise.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,The original Bell & Sejnowski infomax framework only considered the no noise case.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"Results are shown for natural image patches and the mnist dataset, which qualitatively resemble results obtained with other methods.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,This seems like an interesting and potentially more general approach to unsupervised learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,However the paper is quite long and it was difficult for me to follow all the twists and turns.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,For example the introduction of the hierarchical model was confusing and it took several iterations to understand where this was going.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"'Hierarchical' is probably not the right terminology here because it's not like a deep net hierarchy, it's just decomposing the tuning curve function into different parts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"I would recommend that the authors try to condense the paper so that the central message and important steps are conveyed in short order, and then put the more complete mathematical development into a supplementary document.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"Also, the authors should look at the work of Karklin & Simoncelli 2011 which is highly related.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYbF1slg,"They also use an infomax framework for a noisy neural population to derive on and off cells in the retina, and they show the conditions under which orientation selectivity emerges.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,It is not clear to me at all what this paper is contributing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"Deep CCA (Andrew et al, 2013) already gives the gradient derivation of the correlation objective with respect to the network outputs which are then back-propagated to update the network weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"Again, the paper gives the gradient of the correlation (i.e. the CCA objective) w.r.t.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"the network outputs, so it is confusing to me when authors say that their differentiable version enables them to back-propagate directly through the computation of CCA.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"After a second look of the paper, I am still confused what the authors are trying to achieve.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,The CCA objective is not differentiable in the sense that the sum of singular values (trace norm) of T is not differentiable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"It appears to me (from the title, and section 3), the authors are trying to solve this problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"However,",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,Did the authors simply reformulate the CCA objective or change the objective?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,The authors need to be explicit here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"What is the relationship between the retrieval objective and the ""CCA layer""?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"I could imagine different ways of combining them, such as combination or bi-level optimization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,And I could not find discussion about this in section 3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"For this, equations would be helpful.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"Even though the CCA objective is not differentiable in the above sense, it has not caused major problem for training (e.g., in principle we need batch training, but empirically using large minibatches works fine).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,The authors need to justify why the original gradient computation is problematic for what the authors are trying to achieve.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"From the authors' response to my question 2, it seems they still use SVD of T, so I am not sure if the proposed method has advantage in computational efficiency.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"In terms of paper organization, it is better to describe the retrieval objective earlier than in the experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,And I still encourage the authors to conduct the comparison with contrastive loss that I mentioned in my previous comments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,The authors propose to combine a CCA objective with a downstream loss.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,This is a really nice and natural idea.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"However, both the execution and presentation leave a lot to be desired in the current version of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,It is not clear what the overall objective is.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,This was asked in a pre-review question but the answer did not fully clarify it for me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"Is it the sum of the CCA objective and the final (top-layer) objective, including the CCA constraints?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,Is there some interpolation of the two objectives?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"By saying that the top-layer objective is ""cosine distance"" or ""squared cosine distance"", do you really mean you are just minimizing this distance between the matched pairs in the two views?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"If so, then of course that does not work out of the box without the intervening CCA layer:  You could minimize it by setting all of the projections to a single point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"A better comparison would be against a contrastive loss like the Hermann & Blunsom one mentioned in the reviewer question, which aims to both minimize the distance for matched pairs and separate mismatched ones (where ""mismatched"" ones can be uniformly drawn, or picked in some cleverer way).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,But other discriminative top-layer objectives that are tailored to a downstream task could make sense.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,There is some loose terminology in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"The authors refer to the ""correlation"" and ""cross-correlation"" between two vectors.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"""Correlation"" normally applies to scalars, so you need to define what you mean here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"""Cross-correlation"" typically refers to time series.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,In eq.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,(2) you are taking the max of a matrix.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,"Finally I am not too sure in what way this approach is ""fully differentiable"" while regular CCA is not",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,perhaps it is worth revisiting this term as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,Also just a small note about the relationship between cosine distance and correlation:  they are related when we view the dimensions of each of the two vectors as samples of a single random variable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,In that case the cosine distance of the (mean-normalized) vectors is the same as the correlation between the two corresponding random variables.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,In CCA we are viewing each dimension of the vectors as its own random variable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rywUcQogx,So I fear the claim about cosine distance and correlation is a bit of a red herring here.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,The proposed approach addresses several of the challenges.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,"However, there are several concerns.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,"1) The main concern is that there are no comparisons or even mentions of the work done by Tamara Berg’s group on fashion recognition and fashion attributes, e.g.,",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,"While the paper presents an interesting exploration, all these concerns would need to be addressed before the paper can be ready for publication.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,This paper introduces a pratical large-scale visual search system for a fashion site.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,It uses RNN to recognize multi-label attributes and uses state-of-art faster RCNN to extract features inside those region-of-interest (ROI).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,The technical contribution of this paper is not clear.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,Most of the approaches used are standard state-of-art methods and there are not a lot of novelties in applying those methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,"For multi-label recognition task, there are other available methods, e.g. using binary models, changing cross-entropy loss function, etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,There aren't any comparison between the RNN method and other simple baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyWDCXjgx,The order of the sequential RNN prediction is not clear either.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"The argument could be improved by using more-realistic image data and drawing more direct correspondence with the number, receptive field sizes and eccentricities of retinal cells in e.g. the macaque, but the authors would then face the challenge of identifying a loss function that is both biologically plausible and supportive of their claim.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,The argument could also be improved by commenting on the timescales involved.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"Presumably the density of the foveal center depends on the number of of saccades allowed by the inference process, as well as the size of the target sub-images, and also has an impact on the overall classification accuracy.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,This seems so high that the model may not be working the way we’d like it to.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,It seems that the overall argument of the paper pre-supposes that the model can be trained to be a good classifier.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"If there are other training strategies or other models that work better and differently, then it raises the question of why do our eyes and visual cortex not work more like *those ones* if evolutionary pressures are applying the same pressure as our training objective.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"It would be more interesting if the authors could conduct  the model on real datasets, such as Toronto Face dataset, CUB bird dataset and SVHN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"For example, for the Face dataset, it would be nice if the model can learn to attend different parts of the face for expression recognition, or attend different part of birds for fine-grained classification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"Since the authors replied in the pre-review question that the model can learn meaningful lattice on MSCOCO dataset, I think it would be better to add that results into the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,Another drawback of the model is that the paper only compare with different variants of itselves.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJJKxrsgl,"I suggest that this paper should compare with  Spatial Transformer Networks, DRAW, etc., on the same dataset to show the advantage of the learned sampling lattice.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,The general types of the tasks that they try out their approach on spans a wide and interesting spectrum of cognition abilities.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,The writing is pretty clear.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,I basically felt like I could replicate much of what they did from their paper descriptions.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,*,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"The evaluation of the success of these ideas, as compared to other possible approaches, or as compared to human performance on similar tasks, is extremely cursory.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,* The specific tasks that they try are quite simple.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,I really don't know whether their approach is better than a bunch of simpler things on these tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"Taking these two cons together, it feels like the authors basically get the implementation done and working somewhat, and then just wrote up the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,(I know how it feels to be under a deadline without a complete set of results.),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"If the authors had used their approach to solve an obviously hard problem that previously was completely unsolved, even the type of cursory evaluation level chosen here would have been fine.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"Or if they had done a very thorough evaluation of a bunch of standard models on each task (and humans too, ideally), and compared their model to those results, that would have been great.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"But given the complexity of their methods and the fact that the tasks are either not well-known benchmarks or very challenging as such, it's really hard to tell how much of an advance is made here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,But it does seem like a potentially fruitful research direction.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"This paper proposes a setting to learn models that will seek information (e.g., by asking question) in order to solve a given task.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,They introduce a set of tasks that were designed for that goal.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,They show that it is possible to train models to solve these tasks with reinforcement learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,One key motivation for the tasks proposed in this work are the existence of games like 20Q or battleships where an agent needs to ask questions to solve a given task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,It is quite surprising that the authors do not actually consider these games as potential tasks to explore (beside the Hangman).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,It is also not completely clear how the tasks have been selected.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"A significant amount of work has been dedicated in the past to understand the property of games like 20Q (e.g., Navarro et al., 2010) and how humans solve them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"It would interesting to see how the tasks proposed in this work distinguish themselves from the ones studied in the existing literature, and how humans would perform on them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"In particular, Cohen & Lake, 2016m have recently studied the 20 questions games in their paper “Searching large hypothesis spaces by asking questions” where they both evaluate the performance of humans and computer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,I believe that this paper would really benefits from a similar study.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,Developing the ability of models to actively seek for information to solve a task is a very interesting but challenging problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"In this paper, all of the  tasks require the agent to select a questions from a finite set of clean and informative possibilities.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,This allows a simpler analysis of how a given agent may perform but at the cost of a reducing the level of noise that would appear in more realistic settings.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"This paper also show that by using a relatively standard mix of deep learning models and reinforcement learning, they are able to train agents that can solve these tasks in the way it was intended to.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,This validates their empirical setting but also may exhibit some of the limitation of their approach; using relatively toy-ish settings with perfect information and a fixed number of questions may be too simple.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"While it is interesting to see that their agent are able to perform well on all of their tasks, the absence of baselines limit the conclusions we can draw from these experiments.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"For example in the Hangman experiment, it seems that the frequency based model obtains promising performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,It would interesting to see how good are baselines that may use the co-occurrence of letters or the frequency of character n-grams.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"Overall, this paper explores a very interesting direction of research and propose a set of promising tasks to test the capability of a model to learn from asking question.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"However, the current analysis of the tasks is a bit limited, and it is hard to draw any conclusion from them.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"It would be good if the paper would focus more on how humans perform on these tasks, on strong simple baselines and on more tasks related to natural language (since it is one of the motivation of this work) rather than on solving them with relatively sophisticated models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,This paper proposed to use Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to optimize DNNs for information seeking tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,The task is posed as a reinforcement learning problem and the proposed method explicitly promotes information gain to encourage exploration.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,Both GAE and DNN have been used for RL before.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,The novelty in this paper seems to be the explicit modeling of information gain.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate the benefit and generality of the proposed method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,An apple to apple comparison to previous RL framework that doesn't model information gain is missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,"For example, the cluttered MNIST experiment tried to compare against Mnih et al. (2014) (which is a little out dated) with two settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,But in both setting the input to the two methods are different.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,Thus it is unclear what contributed to the performance difference.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,The experiment section is cluttered and hard to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyW2QSige,A table that summarizes the numbers would be much better.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,This work proposed a simple but strong baseline for parametric texture synthesis.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"In empirical experiments, samples generated by the baseline composed by multi-scale and random filters sometime rival the VGG-based model which has multi-layer and pre-trained filters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,The authors concluded that texture synthesis does not necessarily depend on deep hierarchical representations or the learned feature maps.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,This work is indeed interesting and insightful.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"However, the conclusions are needed to be further testified (especially for deep hierarchical representations).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Firstly, all of generated samples by both VGG and single layer model are not perfect and much worse than the results from non-parametric methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,Besides VGG-based model seems to do better in inpainting task in Figure 7.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Last but not least, would a hierarchical model (instead of lots of filters with different size) handle multi-scale more efficiently?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,This paper provides an interesting analysis of the conditions which enable generation of natural looking textures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"The results is quite surprising, and analysis is quite thorough.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"I do think the evaluation methods require more work, but as other reviewers mentioned this could be an interesting line of work moving forwards and does not take too much from this current paper which, I think, should be accepted.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,The framework of Gatys et al. demonstrated that correlation statistics (empirical Gram matrices) of deep feature responses provide an excellent characterisation of visual textures.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,This paper investigates in detail which kind of deep or shallow networks may work well in this framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"One of the main findings is that that very shallow nets, consisting of a single filter bank with random weights, work surprisingly well, and for simple and regular textures may produce results which are visually superior to complex data-adapted filters such as the ones in networks like VGG-19.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"More broadly, the paper contains an interesting and informative discussion on the strength and limitations on such methods for texture synthesis.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,Figure 4 shows that the optimisation of images with respect to shallow filter banks may result in texture images that have a lower VGG-19 loss than optimising the VGG-19 objective directly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a reasonable explanation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"In the new supplementary material, the authors show that better optimisation results can be obtained by initialising the VGG-19-based optimisation with the shallow network optimisation results, which is a useful complement to the original experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,The main limitation of the paper is that it does not systematically compare different methods against a quantifiable objective.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"It is trivial to define image statistics that would allow to simply generate an exact copy of any reference texture, hence with very good visual quality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,Such trivial statistics would also be very shallow.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"The aim is instead to capture a texture distribution, and measuring how well a method meets this challenge remains an open problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Hence, while the empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that simple statistics are good enough for texture synthesis both in terms of quality and diversity (when compared to more complex statistics), it is difficult to conclusively confirm that this is the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,The authors indicate that diversity could be measured in terms of entropy.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"This is reasonable, but, as they acknowledge in their answers to questions, difficult to do in practice.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Furthermore, this would still not account for the other aspect of the problem, namely visual quality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"They also suggest to perform a psychophysical assessment, which may be the only practical way of addressing this problem, but deem that to be material for future work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Overall, since evaluation of image generation is such an hard problem, I think the paper still has sufficient strengths to warrant publication in ICLR.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,"Still, some form of psychophysical assessment would be useful to confirm the intuitions that, at present, can only be obtained by inspecting the figure sin the paper and in the supplementary material.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJk01vogl,It is not a big surprise that a deterministic deep network can be easily tricked; it would be much more interesting to see if the probabilistic aspect of generative models makes them more robust to such attacks.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"Unfortunately, this approach results in a joint model that has some undesirable properties: a unknown normalisation constant for the joint model and therefore an intractable log-likelihood on the test set; and it makes drawing exact samples from the joint model intractable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"These problems can unfortunately not be fixed by using different base learners, but are a direct result of the product of experts formulation of boosting.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,The experiments on 2 dimensional toy data illustrate that the proposed procedure works in principle and that the boosting formulation produces better results than individual weak learners and better results than e.g. bagging.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,But the experiments on MNIST are less convincing: Without an undisputable measure like e.g. log-likelihood it is hard to draw conclusions from the samples in Figure 2; and visually they look weak compared to even simple models like e.g. NADE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"I think the paper could be improved significantly by adding a quantitative analysis: investigating the effect of combining undirected (e.g. RBM), undirected (e.g. VAE) and autoregressive (e.g. NADE) models and by measuring the improvement over the number of base learners.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,But this would require a method to estimate the partition function Z or estimating some proxy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"The paper proposes two approaches to boosting generative models, both based on likelihood ratio estimates.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"The approaches are evaluated on synthetic data, as well as on MNIST dataset for the tasks of generating samples and semi-supervised learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"While the idea of boosting generative models and the proposed methods are interesting, the reviewer finds the experiments unconvincing for the following reasons.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"1. The bagging baseline in section 3.1 seems to be just refitting a model to the same dataset, raising the probability to power alpha, and renormalizing. This makes it more peaked, but it's not clear why this is a good baseline. Please let me know if I misunderstood the procedure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,"2. The sample generation experiment in section 3.2 uses a very slowly converging Markov chain, as can be seen in the similarity of plots c and f, d and g, e and h. It seems unlikely therefore that the resulting samples are from the stationary distribution. A qualitative evaluation using AIS seems to be necessary here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,3. In the same section the choices for alphas seem quite arbitrary - what happens when a more obvious choice of alpha_i=1 for all i is made?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,4. It seems hard to infer anything from the semisupervised classification results reported: the baseline RBM seems to perform as well as the boosted models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyY4Owjll,The work is mostly clearly written and (as far as the reviewer knows) original.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"Summary: The paper presents an approach – Neural Answer Construction Model for the task of answering non-factoid questions, in particular, love-advice questions. The two main features of the proposed model are the following – 1) it incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings, 2) in addition to optimizing for closeness between questions and answers, it also optimizes for optimum combination of sentences in the predicted answer. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset from a Japanese online QA service and is shown to outperform the baseline model (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely). The paper also experiments with few other baseline models (ablations of the proposed model).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Strengths:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"1. The two motivations behind the proposed approach – need to understand the ambiguous use of words depending on context, and need to generate new answers rather than just selecting from answers held by QA sites – are reasonable.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"2. The novelty in the paper involves the following – 1) incorporating biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings using paragraph2vec like model, modified to take as inputs - words from questions, question title token and question category token, 2) modelling optimum combination of sentences (conclusion and supplement sentences) in the predicted answer, 3) designing abstract scenario for answers, inspired by automated web-service composition framework (Rao & Su (2005)), and 4) extracting important topics in conclusion sentence and emphasizing them in supplemental sentence using attention mechanism (attention mechanism is similar to Tan et al. 2016).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,3. The proposed method is shown to outperform the current best method (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely) which seems to be significant improvement.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"4. The paper presents few ablations studies that provide insights on how much different components of the model (such as incorporating biases into word embeddings, incorporating attention from conclusion to supplement) are helping towards performance improvement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Weaknesses/Suggestions/Questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"1. How are the abstract patterns determined, i,e., how did the authors determine that the answers to love-advice questions generally constitute of sympathy, conclusion, supplement for conclusion and encouragement? How much is the improvement in performance when using abstract patterns compared to the case when not using these patters, i.e. when candidate answers are picked from union of all corpuses rather than picking from respective corpuses (corpuses for sympathy, conclusion etc.).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"2. It seems that the abstract patterns are specific to the type of questions. So, the abstract patterns for love-advice will be different from those for business advice. Thus, it seems like the abstract patterns need to be hand-coded for different types and hence one model cannot generalize across different types.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,3. The paper should present explicit analysis of how much combinational optimization between sentences help – comparison between model performance with and without combinational optimization keeping rest of the model architecture same. The authors could also plot the accuracy of the model as a function of the combinational optimization scores. This will provide insights into how significant are the combinational optimization scores towards overall model accuracy.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"4. Paper says that current systems designed for non-factoid QA cannot generalize to questions outside those stored in QA sites and claims that this is one of the contributions of this paper. In order to ground that claim, the paper should show experimentally how well the proposed method generalized to such out-of-domain questions. Although the questions asked by human experts in the human evaluation were not from the evaluation datasets, the paper should analyze how different those questions were compared to the questions present in the evaluation datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"5. For human evaluation, were the outputs of the proposed model and that of the QA-LSTM model judged each judged by both the human experts OR one of the human experts judged the outputs of one system and the other human expert judged the outputs of the other system? If both the sets of outputs were each judged by both the human experts, how were the ratings of the two experts combined for every questions?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"6. I wonder why the authors did not do a human evaluation where they just ask human workers (not experts) to compare the output of the proposed model with that of the QA-LSTM model – which of the two outputs they would like to hear when asking for advice. Such an evaluation would not get biased by whether each sentence is good or not, whether the combination is good or not. Looking at the qualitative examples in Table 4, I personally like the output of the QA-LSTM more than that of the proposed model because they seem to provide a direct answer to the question (e.g., for the first example the output of the QA-LSTM says “You should wait until you feel excited”, whereas the output of the proposed model says “It is better to concentrate on how to confess your love to her” which seems a bit indirect to the question asked.)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"7. Given a question, is the ground-truth answer different in the two tasks",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,answer selection and answer construction?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"8. The paper mentions that Attentive LSTM (Tan et al. 2016) is evaluated as the current best answer selection method (section 5.2). So, why is its accuracy lower than that of QA-LSTM in table 1. The authors explain this by pointing out the issue of questions being very long compared to answers and hence the attention being noisy. But, did these issues not exist in the dataset used by Tan et al. 2016?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"9. The paper says the proposed method achieves 20% gain over current best (in Conclusion section) where they refer to QA-LSTM as the current best method. However, in the description of Attentive LSTM (section 5.2), the paper mentions that Attention LSTM is the current best method. So, could authors please clarify the discrepancy?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,10. Minor correction: remove space between 20 and % in abstract.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Review Summary: The problem of non-factoid QA being dealt with in the paper is an interesting and useful problem to solve.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,The motivations presented in the paper behind the proposed approach are reasonable.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"However, the use of abstract patterns to determine the answer seems like hand-designing and hence it seems like these abstract patterns need to be designed for every other type of non-factoid question and hence the proposed approach is not generalizable to other types.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"Also, the paper needs more analysis of the results to provide insights into the contribution of different model components.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"This paper extends mostly on top of the work of QA-biLSTM and QA-biLSTM with attentions, as proposed in Tan et al. 2015 and Tan et al. 2016, in the following 2 ways:",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Experiments are conducted on a Japanese love advice corpus; the coolest part of the paper for me was that the model was actually rolled out to the public and its answers were rated twice as good as actual human contributors!,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"The authors mention that their model ""fills the gap",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"between answer selection and generation""; however, no generation is actually performed by the model!",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"Instead, the model appears to be very similar to the QA-LSTM of Tan et al., 2015 except that there are additional terms in the objective to handle conclusion and supplementary sentences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"The structure of the answer is fixed to a predefined template (e.g., conclusion",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"> supplementary), so the model is not really learning how to order the sentences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"The other contribution is the ""word embedding with semantics"" portion described in sec 4.1, which is essentially just the paragraph vector model except with ""titles"" and ""categories"" instead of paragraphs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,"While the result of the paper is a model that has actually demonstrated real-life usefulness, the technical contributions do not strike me as novel enough for publication at ICLR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Other comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,One major issue with the reliance of the model on the template is that you can't evaluate on commonly-used non-factoid QA datasets such as InsuranceQA.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,The examples in Table 4 don't show a clear edge in answer quality to your model; QA-LSTM seems to choose good answers as well.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQbbFile,Doesn't the construction model have an advantage over the vanilla QA-LSTM in that it knows which sentences are conclusions and which are supplementary?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"Authors position their work as an alternative to CCA-based multiview learning; note, however, that CCA based techniques have very different purpose and are rather broadly applicable than the setting considered here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,Main points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,I am not sure what authors mean by time complexity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,It would appear that they simply report the computational cost of evaluating the objective in equation (7).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,Is there a sense of how many iterations of the L-BFGS method?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"Since that is going to be difficult given the nature of the optimization problem, one would appreciate some sense of how hard or easy it is in practice to optimize the objective in (7) and how that varies with various problem dimensions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"Authors argue that scalability is not their first concern, which is understandable, but if they are going to make some remarks about the computational cost, it better be clarified that the reported cost is for some small part of their overall approach rather than “time complexity”.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"Since authors position their approach as an alternative to CCA, they should remark about how CCA, even though a nonconvex optimization problem, can be solved exactly with computational cost that is linear in the data size and only quadratic with dimensionality even with a naive implementation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"The method proposed in the paper does not seem to be tractable, at least not immediately.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,The empirical results with synthetic data are a it confusing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"First of all the data generation procedure is quite convoluted, I am not sure why we need to process each coordinate separately in different groups, and then permute and combine etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,A simple benchmark where we take different linear transformations of a shared representation and add independent noise would suffice to confirm that the proposed method does something reasonable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,I am also baffled why CCA does not recover the true subspace - arguably it is the level of additive noise that would impact the recoverability - however the proposed method is nearly exact so the noise level is perhaps not so severe.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,It is also not clear if authors are using regularization with CCA - without regularization CCA can be have in a funny manner.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,This needs to be clarified.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,This paper presents an multi-view learning algorithm which projects the inputs of different views (linearly) such that the neighborhood relationship (transition probabilities) agree across views.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,This paper has good motivation,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,to study multi-view learning from a more information retrieval perspective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,Some concerns:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,The time complexity of the algorithm in its current form is high (see last paragraph of page 4).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"This might be the reason why the authors have conducted experiments on small datasets, and using linear projections.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"The proposed method does have some nice properties, e.g., it does not require the projections to have the same dimension across views (I like this).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"While it more directly models neighborhood relationship than CCA based approaches, it is still not directly optimizing typical retrieval (e.g., ranking-based) criteria.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"While the authors have argued that linear projection may provide better interpretability, I have not found empirical justification in this paper.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,"I agree that the general approach here generalizes to nonlinear projections easily, but the fact that the authors have not conducted experiments with nonlinear projections and comparisons with nonlinear variants of CCA and other multi-view learning algorithms limits the significance of the current paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,The authors develop a way learn subspaces of multiple views such that data point neighborhoods are similar in all of the views.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,This similarity is measured between distributions of neighbors in pairs of views.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,The motivation is that this is a natural criterion for information retrieval.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk-mgcsgx,I like the idea of preserving neighborhood relationships across views for retrieval tasks.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,Originality & Significance:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,The authors proposed an active learning training framework.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,"The idea is to treat the network parameter optimization problem as a Bayesian inference problem (which is proposed previously by Graves) and formulate the active learning problem as that of sampling the most informative data, where the informativeness is defined by the variational free energy, which depends on the Fisher information.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,The active learning criterion is a greedy selection scheme based on variational free energy and a series of approximations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,"The paper is sometimes hard to read, due to (a) many grammatical errors and (b) sloppy notation in some places (e.g., on page 5, line 1, f is used but never introduced before).",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,I'm surprised by the new results on uncertainty sampling and curriculum learning the authors added: why do these methods both break for USPS?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryaFG5ige,"In particular, uncertainty sampling did very well (in fact, better than the authors' new method) on MNIST, but apparently horribly on USPS; some explanation for this would be useful.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"However, while the work has nuggets of very interesting observations, I feel they can be put together in a better way.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,I think the writeup and everything can be improved and I urge the authors to strive for this if the paper doesn't go through.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"I think some of the ideas of how to connect to the past are interesting, it would be nice to have more experiments or to try to understand better why this connections help and how.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,This paper proposes an idea of looking n-steps backward when modelling sequences with RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"The proposed RNN does not only use the previous hidden state (t-1) but also looks further back ( (t - k) steps, where k=1,2,3,4 ).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,The paper also proposes a few different ways to aggregate multiple hidden states from the past.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,The reviewer can see few issues with this paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"Firstly, the writing of this paper requires improvement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,The introduction and abstract are wasting too much space just to explain unrelated facts or to describe already well-known things in the literature.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,Some of the statements written in the paper are misleading.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"For instance, it explains, “Among various neural network models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are appealing for modeling sequential data because they can capture long term dependency in sequential data using a simple mechanism of recurrent feedback” and then it says RNNs cannot actually capture long-term dependencies that well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,RNNs are appealing in the first place because they can handle variable length sequences and can model temporal relationships between each symbol in a sequence.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"The criticism against LSTMs is hard to accept when it says: LSTMs are slow and because of the slowness, they are hard to scale at larger tasks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,But we all know that some companies are already using gigantic seq2seq models for their production (LSTMs are used as building blocks in their systems).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,This indicates that the LSTMs can be practically used in a very large-scale setting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"Secondly, the idea proposed in the paper is incremental and not new to the field.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,There are other previous works that propose to use direct connections to the previous hidden states [1].,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"However, the previous works do not use aggregation of multiple number of previous hidden states.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"Most importantly, the paper fails to deliver a proper analysis on whether its main contribution is actually helpful to improve the problem posed in the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"The new architecture is said that it handles the long-term dependencies better, however, there is no rigorous proof or intuitive design in the architecture that help us to understand why it should work better.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"By the design of the architecture, and speaking in very high-level, it seems like the model maybe helpful to mitigate the vanishing gradients issue by a linear factor.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,It is always a good practice to have at least one page to analyze the empirical findings in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"Thirdly, the baseline models used in this paper are very weak.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"Their are plenty of other models that are trained and tested on word-level language modelling task using Penn Treebank corpus, but the paper only contains a few of outdated models.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByZvfijeg,"I cannot fully agree on the statement “To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance on PTB under the same training condition”, these days, RNN-based methods usually score below 80 in terms of the test perplexity, which are far lower than 100 achieved in this paper.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"In this paper, the authors extend the f-GAN by using Bregman divergences for density ratio matching.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,The argument against f-GAN (which is a generalization of the regular GAN) is that the actual objective optimized by the generator during training is different from the theoretically motivated objective due to gradient issues with the theoretically motivated objective.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"In b-GANS, the discriminator is a density ratio estimator (r(x) = p(x) / q(x)), and the generator tries to minimize the f-divergence between p and q by writing p(x) = r(x)q(x).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,My main problem with this paper is that it is unclear why any of this is useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"The connection to density estimation is interesting, but any derived conclusions between the two seem questionable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"For example, in previous density estimation literature, the Pearson divergence is more stable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,The authors claim that the same holds for GANS and try to show this in their experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Unfortunately, the experiments section is very confusing with unilluminating figures.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,Looking at the graph of density ratios is not particularly illuminating.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"They claim that for the Pearson divergence and modified KL-divergence, ""the learning did not stop"" by looking at the graph of density ratios.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,This is completely hand-wavey and no further evidence is given to back this claim.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Also, why was the normal GAN objective not tried in light of this analysis?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Furthermore, it seems that despite criticizing normal GANs for using a heuristic objective for the generator, multiple heuristics objectives and tricks are used to make b-GAN work.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,I think this paper would be much improved if it was rewritten in a clear fashion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"As it stands, it is difficult to understand the motivation or intuition behind this work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"This paper proposes b-GAN, which trains a discriminator by estimating density ratio that minimizes Bregman divergence.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"The authors also discuss how b-GANs relate to f-GAN and the original GAN work, providing a unifying view through the lens of density ratio estimation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,Note that the unifying view applies only to GAN variants which optimize density ratios.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"In general, GANs which use MMD in the discriminator step do not fit in the b-GAN framework except for special choices of the kernel.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,I was a bit confused about the dual relationship between f-GAN and b-GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,Are the conditions on the function f the same in both cases?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"If so, what's the difference between f-GAN and b-GAN (other than the fact that the former has been derived using f-divergence and the latter has been derived using Bregman divergence)?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,One of the original claims was that b-GANs optimize f-divergence directly as opposed to f-GAN and GAN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"However, in practice, the authors optimize an approximation to the f-divergence; the quality of the approximation is not quantified anywhere, so b-GAN doesn't seem more principled than f-GAN and GAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,The experiments left me a bit confused and were not very illuminating on the choice of f.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Overall, I liked the connections to the density ratio estimation literature.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,The appendix seems like a scattered collection right now.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,Some re-writing of the text would significantly improve this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"This submission introduces a formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) under the lens of density ratio estimation, when using Bregman divergences.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Even thought GANs already perform density estimation, the motivation of using Bregman divergences is to obtain an objective function with stronger gradients.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,I have three concerns with this submission.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"First, the exposition of the paper must be significantly improved.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"The current version of the manuscript is at some points unreadable, and does a poor job at motivating, describing, and justifying the contributions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Second, the authors scatter a variety of alternatives and heuristics throughout the description of the proposed b-GAN.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"This introduces a great amount of complexity when it comes to understanding, implementing, and using b-GAN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,Further work is necessary to rule out (in a principled manner!),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,many of the proposed variants of the algorithm.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Third, it is next to impossible to interpret the experimental results, in particular Figures 2, 3, 4.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"The authors claim that these figures show that ""learning does not stop"", but such behavior can also be attributed to the typical chaotic dynamics of GANs.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Even after reading Appendix A, I am left unconvinced on whether the proposed approach provides with any practical advantage (even no comparison is offered to other GAN approaches with similar architectures).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1JG13oee,"Overall, I believe this submission calls for significant improvements before being considered for publication.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,This paper presents an approach for skills transfer from one task to another in a control setting (trained by RL) by forcing the embeddings learned on two different tasks to be close (L2 penalty).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The experiments are conducted in MuJoCo, with a set of experiments being from the state of the joints/links (5.2/5.3) and a set of experiments on the pixels (5.4).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"They exhibit transfer from arms with different number of links, and from a torque-driven arm to a tendon-driven arm.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"One limitation of the paper is that the authors suppose that time alignment is trivial, because the tasks are all episodic and in the same domain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"Time alignment is one form of domain adaptation / transfer that is not dealt with in the paper, that could be dealt with through subsampling, dynamic time warping, or learning a matching function (e.g. neural network).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"General remarks: The approach is compared to CCA, which is a relevant baseline.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"However, as the paper is purely experimental, another baseline (worse than CCA) would be to just have the random projections for ""f"" and ""g"" (the embedding functions on the two domains), to check that the bad performance of the ""no transfer"" version of the model is due to over-specialisation of these embeddings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,I would also add (for information) that the problem of learning invariant feature spaces is also linked to metric learning (e.g. [Xing et al. 2002]).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"More generally, no parallel is drawn with multi-task learning in ML.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"In the case of knowledge transfer (4.1.1), it may make sense to anneal \alpha.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,The experiments feel a bit rushed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"In particular, the performance of the baseline being always 0 (no transfer at all) is uninformative, at least a much bigger sample budget should be tested.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"Also, why does Figure 7.b contain no ""CCA"" nor ""direct mapping"" results?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,Another concern that I have with the experiments: (if/how) did the author control for the fact that the embeddings were trained with more iterations in the case of doing transfer?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"Overall, the study of transfer is most welcomed in RL.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The experiments in this paper are interesting enough for publication, but the paper could have been more thorough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,This paper explores transfer in reinforcement learning between agents that may be morphologically distinct.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The key idea is for the source and target agent to have learned a shared skill, and then to use this to construct abstract feature spaces to enable the transfer of a new unshared skill in the source agent to the target agent.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The paper is related to much other work on transfer that uses shared latent spaces, such as CCA and its variants, including manifold alignment and kernel CCA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,The paper reports on experiments using a simple physics simulator between robot arms consisting of three vs. four links.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"For comparison, a simple CCA based approach is shown, although it would have been preferable to see comparisons for something more current and up to date, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,A three layer neural net is used to construct the latent feature spaces.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The problem of transfer in RL is extremely important, and receives less attention than it should.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,This work uses an interesting hypothesis of trying to construct transfer based on shared skills between source and target agent.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,This is a promising approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"However, the comparisons to related approaches is not very up to date, and the domains are fairly simplistic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,There is little by way of theoretical development of the ideas using MDP theory.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The paper considers the problem of transferring skills between robots with different morphologies, in the context of agents that have to perform several tasks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"A core component of the proposed approach is to use a task-invariant future space, which can be shared between tasks & between agents.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"Compared to previous work (Ammar et al. 2015), it seems the main contribution here is to “assume that good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment” (Sec. 2).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,This is an interesting hypothesis.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"There is also similarity to work by Raimalwala et al (2016), but the authors argue their method is better equipped to handle non-linear dynamics.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"These are two interesting hypotheses, however I don’t see that they have been verified in the presented empirical results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"In particular, the question of the pairing correspondence seems crucial.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,What happens when the time alignment is not suitable.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,Is it possible to use dynamic time warping (or similar method) to achieve reasonable results?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,Robustness to misspecification of the pairing correspondence P seems a major concern.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"In general, more comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Sec.2, would be very valuable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The addition of Sec.5.1 is definitely a right step in this direction, but represents a small portion of the recent work on transfer learning.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"I appreciate that other methods transfer other pieces of information (e.g. the policy), but still if the end goal is better performance, what is worth transferring (in addition to how to do the transfer) should be a reasonable question to explore.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"Overall, the paper tackles an important problem, but this is a very active area of research, and further comparison to other methods would be worthwhile.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The method proposed of transferring the representation is well motivated, cleanly described, and conceptually sound.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyq4yhile,"The assumption that time alignment can be used for the state pairing seems problematic, and should be further validated.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,Two things I'd like to see.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"1) Specifics about the JPEG and JPEG2000 implementations used, and how they were configured.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,One major weakness I see in many papers is they do not include specific encoders and configuration used in comparisons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"Without knowing this, it's hard to know if the comparison was done with a suitably strong JPEG implementation that was properly configured, for example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"2) The comparison to JPEG2000 is unfortunately not that interesting, since that codec does not have widespread usage and likely never will.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,A better comparison would be with WebP performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"Or, even better, both.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,Very nice results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,Is a software implementation of this available to play with?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,This is the most convincing paper on image compression with deep neural networks that I have read so far.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"The paper is very well written, the use of the rate-distortion theory in the objective fits smoothly in the framework.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"The paper is compared to a reasonable baseline (JPEG2000, as opposed to previous papers only considering JPEG).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,I would expect this paper to have a very good impact.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"Yes, please include results on Lena/Barbara/Baboon (sorry, not Gibbons), along with state-of-the-art references with more classical methods such as the one I mentioned in my questions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,I think it is important to clearly state how NN compare to best previous methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"From the submitted version, I still don't know how both categories of methods are positioned.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"This paper extends an approach to rate-distortion optimization to deep encoders and decoders, and from a simple entropy encoding scheme to adaptive entropy coding.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"In addition, the paper discusses the approach’s relationship to variational autoencoders.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"Given that the approach to rate-distortion optimization has already been published, the novelty of this submission is arguably not very high (correct me if I missed a new trick).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"In some ways, this paper even represents a step backward, since earlier work optimized for a perceptual metric where here MSE is used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"However, the results are a visible improvement over JPEG 2000, and I don’t know of any other learned encoding which has been shown to achieve this level of performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,The paper is very well written.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,Equation 10 appears to be wrong and I believe the partition function should depend on g_s(y; theta).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,This would mean that the approach is not equivalent to a VAE for non-Euclidean metrics.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,What was the reason for optimizing MSE rather than a perceptual metric as in previous work?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"Given the author’s backgrounds, it is surprising that even the evaluation was only performed in terms of PSNR.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,What is the contribution of adaptive entropy coding versus the effect of deeper encoders and decoders?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"This seems like an important piece of information, so it would be interesting to see the performance without adaptation as in the previous paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"More detail on the adaptive coder and its effects should be provided, and I will be happy to give a higher score when the authors do.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"This is a nice paper that demonstrates an end-to-end trained image compression and decompression system, which achieves better bit-rate vs quality trade-offs than established image compression algorithms (like JPEG-2000).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"In addition to showing the efficacy of 'deep learning' for a new application, a key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a differentiable version of ""rate"" function, which the authors show can be used for effective training with different rate-distortion trade-offs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,I expect this will have impact beyond the compression application itself,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,for other tasks that might benefit from differentiable approximations to similar functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,The authors provided a thoughtful response to my pre-review question.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"I would still argue that to minimize distortion under a fixed range and quantization, a sufficiently complex network would learn automatically produce  codes within a fixed range with the highest-possible entropy (i.e., it would meet the upper bound).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,But the second argument is convincing,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"doing so forces a specific ""form"" on how the compressor output is used, which to match the effective compression of the current system, would require a more complex network that is able to carry out the computations currently being done by a separate variable rate encoder used to store q.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,This nicely written paper presents an end-to-end learning method for image compression.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,By optimizing for rate-distortion performance and a clever relaxation the method is able to learn an efficient image compression method by optimizing over a database of natural images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg,"As the method is interesting, results are interesting and analysis is quite thorough it's easy for me to recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,This paper proposes an extension of the GAN framework known as GAP whereby multiple generators and discriminators are trained in parallel.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The generator/discriminator pairing is shuffled according to a periodic schedule.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Pros:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,+,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The proposed approach is simple and easy to replicate.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Cons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The paper is confusing to read.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The results are suggestive but do not conclusively show a performance win for GAP.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The main argument of the paper is that GAP leads to improved convergence and improved coverage of modes.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The coverage visualizations are suggestive but there still is not enough evidence to conclude that GAP is in fact improving coverage.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,And for convergence it is difficult to assess the effect of GAP on the basis of learning curves.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The proposed GAM-II metric is circular in that model performance depends on the collection of baselines the model is being compared with.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Estimating likelihood via AIS seems to be a promising way to evaluate, as does using the Inception score.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Perhaps a more systematic way to determine GAP's effect would be to set up a grid search of hyperparameters and train an equal number of GANs and GAP-GANs for each setting.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Then a histogram over final Inception scores or likelihood estimates of the trained models would help to show whether GAP tended to produce better models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Overall the approach seems promising but there are too many open questions regarding the paper in its current form.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"* Section 2: ""Remark that when...""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,=> seems like a to-do.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"This paper proposes to address the mode collapsing problem of GANs by training a large set of generators and discriminators, pairing them each up with different ones at different times throughout training.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The idea here is that no one generator-discriminator pair can be too locked together since they are all being swapped.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,This idea is nice and is addressing an important issue with GAN training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"However, I think the paper is lacking in experimental results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,In particular:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The authors need to do more work to motivate the GAM metric.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,It is not intuitively obvious to me that the GAM metric is a good way of evaluating the generator networks since it relies on the prediction of the discriminator networks which can fixate on artifacts.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Perhaps the authors could explore if the GAM metric correlates with inception scores or human evaluations.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Currently the only quantitative evaluation uses this criterion and it really isn't clear it's a relevant quantity to be measuring.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Related to the above comment, the authors need to compare more to other methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Why not evaluate inception scores and compare with previous methods.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Similarly, generation quality is not compared with previous methods.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,It's not obvious that the sample quality is any better with this method.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,And now just repeating questions from pre-review section:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"If, instead of swapping, you were to simply train K GANs on K splits of the data, or K GANs with differing initial conditions (but without swapping)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,do you see any improvement in results?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Similarly, how about if you train larger capacity models with dropout in G and D?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Since dropout essentially averages many models it would be interesting to see if the effects are the same.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"In figure 6 it appears that the validation costs remain the same as parallelization increase, but the training cost goes up and that is why the gap is shrinking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Does this really imply better generalization?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"In summary, interesting paper that addresses an important issue with GAN training, but compelling results are missing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"This paper proposes Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP), one schedule to train N Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in parallel.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,GAP proceeds by shuffling the assignments between the N generators and the N discriminators at play every few epochs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Therefore, GAP forces each generator to compete with multiple discriminators at random.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"The authors claim that such randomization reduces undesired ""mode collapsing behaviour"", typical of GANs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,I have three concerns with this submission.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"1) After training the N GANs for a sufficient amount of time, the authors propose to choose the best generator using the GAM metric.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,I oppose to this because of two reasons.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"First, a single GAN will most likely be unable to express the full richness of the true data begin modeled.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Said differently, a single generator with limited power will either describe a mode well, or describe many modes poorly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Second, GAM relies on the scores given by the discriminators, which can be ill-posed (focus on artifacts).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Since there is There is nothing wrong with mode collapsing when this happens under control.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Thus, I believe that a better strategy would be to not choose and combine all generators into a mixture.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Of course, this would require a way to decide on mixture weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"This can be done, for instance, using rejection sampling based on discriminator scores.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,2),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The authors should provide a theoretical (or at least conceptual) comparison to dropout.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"In essence, this paper has a very similar flavour: every generator is competing against all N discriminators, but at each epoch we drop N-1 for every generator.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"Related to the previous point, after training dropout keeps all the neurons, effectively approximating a large ensemble of neural networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,3),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The qualitative results are not convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,Most of the figures show only results about GAP.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,How do the baseline samples look like?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,The GAN and LAPGAN papers show very similar samples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"On the other hand, I do not find Figures 3 and 4 convincing: for instance, the generator in Figure 3 was most likely under-parametrized.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"As a minor comment, I would remove Figure 2.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk8J83oee,"This is because of three reasons: it may be protected by copyright, it occupies a lot of space, and it does not add much value to the explanation.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"It investigates two metrics for measuring inter-class similarity: (1) softmax probability outputs, i.e., the class confusion matrix, and (2) L2 distance between fc7 features, along with three methods for constructing the hierarchy given the distance matrix: (1) approximation central point, (2) minimal spanning tree, and (3) multidimensional scaling of Borg&Groenen 2005.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"I’m not sure what we can conclude from the paper beyond the fact that CNNs are able to group categories together based on visual similarities, and deeper networks are able to do this better than more shallow networks (Fig 2).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"In summary, this paper is unfortunately not ready for publication at this time.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,This paper introduces a hierarchical clustering method using learned CNN features to build 'the tree of life'.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,The assumption is that the feature similarity indicates the distance in the tree.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,The authors tried three different ways to construct the tree: 1) approximation central point 2) minimum spanning tree and 3) multidimensional scaling based method.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"Out of them, MDS works the best.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,It is a nice application of using deep features.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following reasons:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,1) All experiments are conducted in very small scale.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"The experiments include 6 fish species, 11 canine species, 8 vehicle classes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"There are no quantitative results, only by visualizing the generated tree versus the wordNet tree.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"Moreover, the assumption of using wordNet is not quite valid.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,WordNet is not designed for biology purpose and it might not reflect the true evolutionary relationship between species.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,2) Limited technical novelty.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"Most parts of the pipeline are standard, e.g. use pretrained model for feature extraction, use previous methods to construct hierarchical clustering.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,I think the technical contribution of this paper is very limited.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,I like this paper in that it is a creative application of computer vision to Biology.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"Or, at least, that would be a good narrative but I'm not confident biologists would actually care about the ""Tree of Life"" built from this method.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"There's not really any biology in this paper, either in methodology or evaluation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"It boils down to a hierarchical clustering of visual categories with ground truth assumed to be the WordNet hierarchy (which may or may not be the biological ground truth inheritance relationships between species, if that is even possible to define",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,it probably isn't for dog species which interbreed and it definitely isn't for vehicles) or the actual biological inheritance tree or what humans would do in the same task.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"If we're just worried about visual relationships and not inheritance relationships then a graph is the right structure, not a tree.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,"A tree is needlessly lossy and imposes weird relationships (e.g. ImageNet has a photo of a ""toy rabbit"" and by tree distance it is maximally distant from ""rabbit"" because the toy is in the devices top level hierarchy and the real rabbit is in the animal branch.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,Are those two images really as semantically unrelated as is possible?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,Our visual world is not a hierarchy.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=r17RD2oxe,This paper doesn't quite do that.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,This paper discusses a method for computing vector representations for documents by using a skip-gram style learning mechanism with an added regularizer in the form of a global context vector with various bits of drop out.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Further, I appreciated the detailed analysis of model behaviour in section 3.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,The main downside to this submission is in its relative weakness on the empirical front.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,Arguably there are more interesting tasks than sentiment analysis and k-way classification!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Likewise, why waste 2/3 of a page on t-sne projections rather than use that space for further analysis?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"While I am a bit disappointed by this reduced evaluation and agree with the other reviewers concerning soft baselines, I think this paper should be accepted: it's an interesting algorithm, nicely composed and very efficient, so it's reasonable to assume that other readers might have use for some of the ideas presented here.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,This paper presents a framework for creating document representations.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,The main idea is to represent a document as an average of its word embeddings with a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing common words to be close to 0.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,Experiments on sentiment analysis and document classification show that the proposed method has the lowest error rates compared to baseline document embedding methods.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"While I like the motivation of finding the best way to encode a document into a vector, the paper does not offer significant technical contributions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Most of the techniques are not new, and the main selling point is the simplicity and speed of the proposed method.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"For this reason, I would like to see good results for more than two tasks to be convinced that this is the best way to learn document representations.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"For RNN-LM, is the LM trained to minimize classification error, or is it trained  as a language model?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Did you use the final hidden state as the representation, or the average of all hidden states?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,One of the most widely used method to represent documents now is to have a bidirectional LSTM and concatenate the final hidden states as the document representation.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,I think it would be useful to know how the proposed method compares to this approach for tasks such as document classification or sentiment analysis.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"This paper proposes learning document embeddings as a sum of the constituent word embeddings, which are jointly learned and randomly dropped out ('corrupted') during training.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"While none of the pieces of this model are particularly novel, the result is an efficient learning algorithm for document representation with good empirical performance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Joint training of word and document embeddings is not a new idea, nor is the idea of enforcing the document to be represented by the sum of its word embeddings (see, e.g. '“The Sum of Its Parts”: Joint Learning of Word and Phrase Representations with Autoencoders' by Lebret and Collobert).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Furthermore, the corruption mechanism is nothing other than traditional dropout on the input layer.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Coupled with the word2vec-style loss and training methods, this paper offers little on the novelty front.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"On the other hand, it is very efficient at generation time, requiring only an average of the word embeddings rather than a complicated inference step as in Doc2Vec.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Moreover, by construction, the embedding captures salient global information about the document",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,it captures specifically that information that aids in local-context prediction.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Igu2ogg,"Overall, despite the lack of novelty, the simplicity, efficiency, and performance of this model make it worthy of wider readership and study, and I recommend acceptance.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,This paper investigates the impact of orthogonal weight matrices on learning dynamics in RNNs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The paper proposes a variety of interesting optimization formulations that enforce orthogonality in the recurrent weight matrix to varying degrees.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The experimental results demonstrate several conclusions: enforcing exact orthogonality does not help learning, while enforcing soft orthogonality or initializing to orthogonal weights can substantially improve learning.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"While some of the optimization methods proposed currently require matrix inversion and are therefore slow in wall clock time, orthogonal initialization and some of the soft orthogonality constraints are relatively inexpensive and may find their way into practical use.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The experiments are generally done to a high standard and yield a variety of useful insights, and the writing is clear.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The experimental results are based on using a fixed learning rate for the different regularization strengths.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"Learning speed might be highly dependent on this, and different strengths may admit different maximal stable learning rates.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,It would be instructive to optimize the learning rate for each margin separately (maybe on one of the shorter sequence lengths) to see how soft orthogonality impacts the stability of the learning process.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Fig.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"5, for instance, shows that a sigmoid improves stability—but perhaps slightly reducing the learning rate for the non-sigmoid Gaussian prior RNN would make the learning well-behaved again for weightings less than 1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Fig.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,4 shows singular values converging around 1.05 rather than 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Does initializing to orthogonal matrices multiplied by 1.05 confer any noticeable advantage over standard orthogonal matrices?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Especially on the T=10K copy task?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"“Curiously, larger margins and even models without sigmoidal constraints on the spectrum (no margin) performed well as long as they were initialized to be orthogonal suggesting that evolution away from orthogonality is not a serious problem on this task.”",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"This is consistent with the analysis given in Saxe et al. 2013, where for deep linear nets, if a singular value is initialized to 1 but dies away during training, this is because it must be zero to implement the desired input-output map.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"More broadly, an open question has been whether orthogonality is useful as an initialization, as proposed by Saxe et al., where its role is mainly as a preconditioner which makes optimization proceed quickly but doesn’t fundamentally change the optimization problem; or whether it is useful as a regularizer, as proposed by Arjovsky et al. 2015 and Henaff et al. 2015, that is, as an additional constraint in the optimization problem (minimize loss subject to weights being orthogonal).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"These experiments seem to show that mere initialization to orthogonal weights is enough to reap an optimization speed advantage, and that too much regularization begins to hurt performance—i.e., substantially changing the optimization problem is undesirable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,This point is also apparent in Fig.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"2: In terms of the training loss on MNIST (Fig. 2), no margin does almost indistinguishably from a margin of 1 or .1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"However in terms of accuracy, a margin of .1 is best.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"This shows that large or nonexistent margins (i.e., orthogonal initializations) enable fast optimization of the training loss, but among models that attain similar training loss, the more nearly orthogonal weights perform better.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,This starts to separate out the optimization speed advantage conferred by orthogonality from the regularization advantage it confers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,It may be useful to more explicitly discuss the initialization vs regularization dimension in the text.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"Overall, this paper contributes a variety of techniques and intuitions which are likely to be useful in training RNNs.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The paper is well-motivated, and is part of a line of recent work investigating the use of orthogonal weight matrices within recurrent neural networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"While using orthogonal weights addresses the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients, it is unclear whether anything is lost, either in representational power or in trainability, by enforcing orthogonality.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"As such, an empirical investigation that examines how these properties are affected by deviation from orthogonality is a useful contribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The paper is clearly written, and the primary formulation for investigating soft orthogonality constraints (representing the weight matrices in their SVD factorized form, which gives explicit control over the singular values) is clean and natural, albeit not necessarily ideal from a practical computational standpoint (as it requires maintaining multiple orthogonal weight matrices each requiring an expensive update step).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,I am unaware of this approach being investigated previously.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The experimental side, however, is somewhat lacking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"The paper evaluates two tasks: a copy task, using an RNN architecture without transition non-linearities, and sequential/permuted sequential MNIST.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"These are reasonable choices for an initial evaluation, but are both toy problems and don't shed much light on the practical aspects of the proposed approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"An evaluation in a more realistic setting would be valuable (e.g., a language modeling task).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"Furthermore, while investigating pure RNN's makes sense for evaluating effects of orthogonality, it feels somewhat academic: LSTMs also provide a mechanism to capture longer-term dependencies, and in the tasks where the proposed approach was compared directly to an LSTM, it was significantly outperformed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"It would be very interesting to see the effects of the proposed soft orthogonality constraint in additional architectures (e.g., deep feed-forward architectures, or whether there's any benefit when embedded within an LSTM, although this seems doubtful).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"Overall, the paper addresses a clear-cut question with a well-motivated approach, and has interesting findings on some toy datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,As such I think it could provide a valuable contribution.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"However, the significance of the work is restricted by the limited experimental settings (both datasets and network architectures).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Vanishing and exploding gradients makes the optimization of RNNs very challenging.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The issue becomes worse on tasks with long term dependencies that requires longer RNNs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,One of the suggested approaches to improve the optimization is to optimize in a way that the transfer matrix is almost orthogonal.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,This paper investigate the role of orthogonality on the optimization and learning which is very important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The writing is sound and clear and arguments are easy to follow.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The suggested optimization method is very interesting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,The main shortcoming of this paper is the experiments which I find very important and I hope authors can update the experiment section significantly.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Below I mention some comments on the experiment section:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,1- I think the experiments are not enough.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"At the very least, report the result on the adding problem and language modeling task on Penn Treebank.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,2- I understand that the copying task becomes difficult with non-lineary.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"However, removing non-linearity makes the optimization very different and therefore, it is very hard to conclude anything from the results on the copying task.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,3- I was not able to find the number of hidden units used for RNNs in different tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"4- Please report the running time of your method in the paper for different numbers of hidden units, compare it with the SGD and mention the NN package you have used.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,"5- The results on Table 1 and Table 2 might also suggest that the orthogonality is not really helpful since even without a margin, the numbers are very close compare to the case when you find the optimal margin.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,Am I right?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,6- What do we learn from Figure 2?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkuVu3ige,It is left without any discussion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"This paper is well written, and well presented.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"This method is using denoise autoencoder to learn an implicit probability distribution helps reduce training difficulty, which is neat.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"In my view, joint training with an auto-encoder is providing extra auxiliary gradient information to improve generator.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,Providing auxiliary information may be a methodology to improve GAN.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,Please add more discussion with EBGAN in next version.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,This paper is about using denoising autoencoders to improve performance in GANs.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"In particular, the features as determined by the discriminator, of images generated by the generator, are fed into a denoising AE and we try to have these be reconstructed well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"I think it's an interesting idea to use this ""extra information""",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,namely the feature representations learned by the discriminator.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,It seems very much in the spirit of ICLR!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"My main concern, though, is that I'm not wholly convinced on the nature of the improvement.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"This method achieves higher inception scores than other methods in some cases, but I have a hard time interpreting these scores and thus a hard time getting excited by the results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"In particular, the authors have not convinced me that the benefits outweigh the required additional sophistication both conceptually and implementation-wise (speaking of which, will code be released?).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"One thing I'd be curious to know is, how hard is it to get this thing to actually work?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"Also, I view GANs as a means to an end",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"while I'm not particularly excited about generating realistic images (especially in 32x32), I'm very excited about the future potential of GAN-based systems.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,So it would have been nice to see these improvements in inception score translate into improvements in a more useful task.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,The authors present a way to complement the Gerative Adversarial Network traning procedure with an additional term based on denoising autoencoders.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,The use of denoising autoencoders is motivated by the observation that they implicitly capture the distribution of the data they were trained on.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"While sampling methods based denoising autoencoders alone don't amount to very interesting generative models (at least no-one could demonstrate otherwise), this paper shows that it can be combined successfully with generative adversarial networks.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1X7nhsxl,"I feel that the idea presented here is not revolutionary or a very radical departure from what has been done before, I would have liked a slightly more structured experiments section which focusses on and provides insights into the relative merits of different choices one could make (see pre-review questions for details), rather than focussing just on demonstrating that a chosen variant works.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,The paper is an extension of the matching networks by Vinyals et al. in NIPS2016.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,The training procedure and experimental setting are very similar to the original matching networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,I am not completely sure about its advantages over the original matching networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"It seems to me when dealing with 1-shot case, these two methods are identical since there is only one example seen in this class, so the mean of the embedding is the embedding itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"When dealing with 5-shot case, original matching networks compute the weighted average of all examples, but it is at most 5x cost.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,The experimental results reported for prototypical nets are only slightly better than matching networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"I  think it is a simple, straightforward,  novel extension, but I am not fully convinced its advantages.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"This paper proposes an improved version of matching networks, with better scalability properties with respect to the support set of a few-shot classifier.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"This is combined with episodic few-shot training with randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes, so that the training and testing scenarios match closely.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"Although the idea is quite straightforward, and there are a great many prior works on zero-shot and few-shot learning, the proposed technique is novel to my knowledge, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several  benchmark datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,One addition that I think would improve the paper is a clearer description of the training algorithm (perhaps pseudocode).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,In its current form the paper a bit vague about this.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,*** Paper Summary ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,This paper simplify matching network by considering only a single prototype per class which is obtained as the average of the embedding of the training class samples.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,Empirical comparisons with matching networks are reported.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,*** Review ***,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,The paper reads well and clearly motivate the work.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,This work of learning metric learning propose to simplify an earlier work (matching network) which is a great objective.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"However, I am not sure it achieve better results than matching networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"The space of learning embeddings to optimize nearest neighbor classification has been explored before, but the idea of averaging the propotypes is interesting (as a non-linear extension of Mensink et al 2013).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,I would suggest to improve the discussion of related work and to consolidate the results section to help distinguish between the methods you outperform and the one you do not.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"The related work section can be extended to include work on learning distance metric to optimize a nearest neighbor classification, see Weinberger et al, 2005 and subsequent work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"Extensions to perform the same task with neural networks can be found in Min et al, 09 that purse a goal very close to yours.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1-Hhnslg,"The learning to rank (for websearch) litterature with triplet supervision or global ranking losses is also highly relevant, ie. one example ""the query"" defines the class and the embedding space need to be such that positive/relevant document are closer to the query than the others.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,This paper explores the ability of nonlinear recurrent neural networks to account for neural response properties that have otherwise eluded the ability of other models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,A multilayer rnn is trained to imitate the stimulus-response mapping measured from actual retinal ganglion cells in response to a sequence of natural images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"The rnn performs significantly better, especially in accounting for transient responses, than conventional LN/GLM models.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,This work is an important step in understanding the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,Recent results have shown that the responses of even retinal ganglion cells in response to natural movies are difficult to explain in terms of standard receptive field models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,So this presents an important challenge to the field.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"If we even had *a* model that works, it would be a starting point.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,So this work should be seen in that light.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,The challenge now of course is to tease apart what the rnn is doing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,Perhaps it could now be pruned and simplified to see what parts are critical to performance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,It would have been nice to see such an analysis.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,Nevertheless this result is a good first start,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,and I think important for people to know about.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,This paper fits models to spike trains of retinal ganglion cells that are driven by natural images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,I think the title should thus include the word “activity” at the end for otherwise it is actually formally incorrect.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"Anyhow, this paper proposes more specifically a recurrent network for this time series prediction and compares it to what seems to be the previous approach of a generalized linear model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,Overall the stated paradigm is that when one can predict the spikes well then one can look into the model and learn how nature does it.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"In general the paper sounds plausible, though I am not convinced that I learned a lot.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,The results in figure 2 show that the RNN model can predict the spikes a bit better.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,But now what?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"You have shown that a more complicated model can produce better fits to the data, though there are of course still some variations to the real data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,Your initial outline was that a better predictive model helps you to better understand the neural processing in the retina.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,So tell us what you learned.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"I am not a specialist of the retina, but I know that there are several layers and recurrencies in the retina, so I am not so surprised that the new model is better than the GLM.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,It seems that more complicated recurrent models such as LSTM do not improve the performance according to a statement in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"However, comparisons on this level are also difficult as a more complex models needs more data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,"Hence, I would actually expect that more layers and even a more detailed model of the retina could eventually improve the prediction even further.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkEI22jeg,I was also a bit puzzled that all the neurons in the network share all the same parameters (weights).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk5upnsxe,"In CVPR, 2009.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors propose a mechanism for selecting the design of filters in convolutional layers.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The basic idea is that convolution should be applied to input feature dimensions that are highly correlated in order to detect rare events.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"For example, adjacent pixels in images are correlated and edges are rare events of interest to be detected.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors argue that square filters are therefore appropriate in images.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"However, in data such as bird songs high correlations might exist between non-adjacent harmonics and a convolution filter should take a weighted summation over these input feature dimensions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Such an operation can thus be thought of computing data-dependent dilated convolutions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Paper theoretically motivates this choice using the idea of Gaussian complexity of the learner (i.e. a CNN in this case).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The main idea being that choosing convolution filters that sum over correlated features results in lower Gaussian complexity and thus the learner has higher ability to generalize.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"While I am no expert in theoretical analysis of learning algorithms – there are parts of proof that look sound, but there are parts that are rather hand wavy (for eg, extension to networks using max-pooling from average pooling).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Also, the theory is not directly applicable to choosing filters when number of layers are more than 1.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,I am willing to overlook the paucity in rigor in some parts of the theoretical arguments because the empirical evidence looks convincing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The method of choosing the filter shape can be briefly summarized as:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,(a) The covariance matrix of the input features is computed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"(b) Using the covariance matrix, feature dimensions with highest correlations are determined by solving equation (7).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,A hard limit on maximum number of filter dimensions is imposed (typically ~ 10-15).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,This leads to choice of a single design for all filters in the layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,(c) Authors extend the framework to work with multiple layers in the following way: A subset of feature dimensions cannot account for all variance in the inputs and there is some residual variance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The filter design of the next layer attempts to minimize this residual variance.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,This process is repeated iteratively by solving eq (8) to obtain filter designs for all the layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Ideally for determining filter designs of different layers – one should have computed the covariance statistics of outputs of the previous layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,However this assumes that filters of the previous layer are already known and this is not computationally feasible to implement.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors instead use the method described in (c).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,A question which comes to my mind is – a single feature design is chosen for each layer.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Have the authors considered using the process in (c) to chose different filter designs for different filters in the same layer as opposed to using the same filter design for all the filters?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Regarding baselines:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,B1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,It would be great to see a comparison with randomly chosen filter designs.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Two comparisons could be made – (1a),0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,A single random design is chosen for each layer.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,(1b),1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The design of each filter is chosen randomly (i.e. allowing for different designs of filter within each layer).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,B2.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Since the theory is not really applicable to CNNs with more that one layer – I wonder how much of the benefit is obtained by choosing the filter design just in a single layer v/s all the layers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,A good comparison would be when filter design of the first layer are chosen using the described method and filters in higher layers are chosen to be square.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,B3.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors mention the use L1 regularization in the baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Was the L1 penalty cross-validated?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"If so, then upto what range?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Somethings which are unclear:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,“exclude data that represent obvious noise”,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,DFMax mentioned in the supplementary materials,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Overall I think this is very interesting idea for filter design.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"The authors have done a fair set of experiments but I would really like to see results of B1, B2 and the answer to question in B3.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"I have currently set my rating to a weak reject, but I am happy to raise my ratings to – “Good paper, accept” if the authors provide results of experiments and answers to questions in my comments above.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,This work proposes a way how to learn filter shapes for CNNs in an unsupervised manner for multiple tasks by solving a lasso problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Even though this method does not seem to be applicable for image classification CNNs (as image data generally do not have bias towards anisotropic structures), it gives an empirical methodology to design filter shapes for tasks with different input data structure.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors show that this method is applicable for spectrogram classification and gene sequence classification.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,The paper is well written and and is of interest to the community as it presents a unsupervised method applicable to problems with less training data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Authors compare the performance of the proposed method against reasonable baselines (i.e. handcrafted filter sizes) and based on the evaluation it seems to improve the results and help to avoid over-fitting (probably due to reduced filter size and thus number of parameters).,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,In this way it is an interesting combination of unsupervised methods for a supervised training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Unfortunately, I am not able to validate correctness of the theoretical justification.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,As a side note:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,* It would be useful to give some reference showing that using spectrogram for sound classification is a reasonable choice,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"The paper proposes a method for optimising the shape of filters in convolutional neural network layers, i.e. the structure of their receptive fields.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"CNNs for images almost invariably feature small square filters (e.g. 3x3, 5x5, ...) and this paper provides an algorithm to optimise this aspect of the model architecture (which is often treated as fixed) based on data.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"It is argued that this is especially useful for data modalities where the assumption of locality breaks down, as in e.g. spectrograms, where correlations between harmonics are often relevant to the task at hand, but they are not local in frequency space.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Improved performance is demonstrated on two tasks that are fairly non-standard, but I think that is fine given that the proposed approach probably isn't useful for the vast majority of popular benchmark datasets (e.g. MNIST, CIFAR-10), where the locality assumption holds and a square filter shape is probably close to optimal anyway.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Fig.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,1 is a nice demonstration of this.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"The paper spends quite a bit of space on a theoretical argument for the proposed method based on Gaussian complexity, which is interesting but maybe doesn't warrant quite so much detail.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"In contrast, section 3.3 (about how to deal with pooling) is quite handwavy in comparison.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,This is probably fine but the level of detail in the preceding sections makes it a bit suspicious.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"I'm also not 100% convinced that the theoretical argument is particularly relevant, because it seems to rely on some assumptions that are clearly untrue for practical CNNs, such as 1-norm weight constraints and the fact that it is probably okay to swap out the L1 norm for the L2 norm.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"I would also like to see a bit more discussion about Fig. 4, especially about the fact that some of the filter shapes end up having many fewer nonzeros than the algorithm enforces (e.g. 3 nonzeros for layers 6 and 7, whereas the maximum is 13).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Of course this is a perfectly valid outcome as the algorithm doesn't force the solution to have an exact number of nonzeros, but surely the authors will agree that it is a bit surprising/unintuitive?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"The same figure also features an interesting phase transition between layers 1-4 and 5-8, with the former 4 layers having very similar, almost circular/square filter shapes, and the later having very different, spread out shapes.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Some comments about why this happens would be welcome.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"Regarding my question about computational performance, I still think that this warrants some discussion in the paper as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"For many new techniques, whether they end up being adopted mainly depends on the ratio between the amount of work that goes into implementing them, and the benefit they provide.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,I'm not convinced that the proposed approach is very practical.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"My intuition is that creating efficient implementations of various non-square convolutions for each new problem might end up not being worth the effort, but I could be wrong here.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,Minor comments:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,please have the manuscript proofread for spelling and grammar.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"there is a bit of repetition in sections 2 and 3, e.g. the last paragraphs of sections 2.1 and 2.2 basically say the same thing, it would be good to consolidate this.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"a few things mentioned in the paper that were unclear to me (""syllables"", ""exclude data that represent obvious noise"", choice of ""max nonzero elements"" parameter) have already been adequately addressed by the authors in their response to my questions, but it would be good to include these answers in the manuscript as well.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"the comparison in Fig. 5 with L1 regularisation on the filter weights does not seem entirely fair, since the resulting shape would have to be encompassed in a 5x5 window whereas Fig.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,4 shows that the filter shapes found by the algorithm often extend beyond that.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1TER2oll,"I appreciate that training nets with very large square filters is problematic in many ways, but the claim ""L1 regularization cannot achieve the same effect as filter shaping"" is not really convincingly backed up by this experiment.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,This paper introduces a new way of extending the count based exploration approach to domains where counts are not readily available.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The way in which the authors do it is through hash functions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Experiments are conducted on several domains including control and Atari.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"It is nice that the authors confirmed the results of Bellemare in that given the right ""density"" estimator, count based exploration can be effective.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"It is also great the observe that given the right features, we can crack games like Montezuma's revenge to some extend.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"I, however, have several complaints:",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"First, by using hashing, the authors did not seem to be able to achieve significant improvements over past approaches.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Without ""feature engineering"", the authors achieved only a fraction of the performance achieved in Bellemare et al. on Montezuma's Revenge.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The proposed approaches In the control domains, the authors also does not outperform VIME.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"So experimentally, it is very hard to justify the approach.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Second, hashing, although could be effective in the domains that the authors tested on, it may not be the best way of estimating densities going forward.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"As the environments get more complicated, some learning methods, are required for the understanding of the environments instead of blind hashing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The authors claim that the advantage of the proposed method over Bellemare et al. is that one does not have to design density estimators.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"But I would argue that density estimators have become readily available (PixelCNN, VAEs, Real NVP, GANs) that they can be as easily applied as can hashing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Training the density estimators is not difficult problem as more.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The paper proposes a new exploration scheme for reinforcement learning using locality-sensitive hashing states to build a table of visit counts which are then used to encourage exploration in the style of MBIE-EB of Strehl and Littman.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Several points are appealing about this approach: first, it is quite simple compared to the current alternatives (e.g. VIME, density estimation and pseudo-counts).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Second, the paper presents results across several domains, including classic benchmarks, continuous control domains, and Atari 2600 games.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"In addition, there are results for comparison from several other algorithms (DQN variants), many of which are quite recent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The results indicate that the approach clearly improves over the baseline.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The results against other exploration algorithms are not as clear (more dependent on the individual domain/game), but I think this is fine as the appeal of the technique is its simplicity.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Third, the paper presents results on the sensitivity to the granularity of the abstraction.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"I have only one main complaint, which is it seems there was some engineering involved to get this to work, and I do not have much confidence in the robustness of the conclusions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,I am left uncertain as to how the story changes given slight perturbations over hyper-parameter values or enabling/disabling of certain choices.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"For example, how critical was using PixelCNN (or tying the weights?) or noisifying the output in the autoencoder, or what happens if you remove the custom additions to BASS?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The granularity results show that the choice of resolution is sensitive, and even across games the story is not consistent.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The authors decide to use state-based counts instead of state-action based counts, deviating from the theory, which is odd because the reason to used LSH in the first place is to get closer to what MBIE-EB would advise via tabular counts.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,There are several explanations as to why state-based versus state-action based counts perform similarly in Atari; the authors do not offer any.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Why?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"It seems like the technique could be easily used in DQN as well, and many of the variants the authors compare to are DQN-based, so omitting DQN here again seems strange.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The authors justify their choice of TRPO by saying it ensures safe policy improvement, though it is not clear that this is still true when adding these exploration bonuses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The case study on Montezuma's revenge, while interesting, involves using domain knowledge and so does not really fit well with the rest of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"So, in the end, simple and elegant idea to help with exploration tested in many domains, though I am not certain which of the many pieces are critical for the story to hold versus just slightly helpful, which could hurt the long-term impact of the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,After response:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Thank you for the thorough response, and again my apologies for the late reply.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,I appreciate the follow-up version on the robustness of SimHash and state counting vs. state-action counting.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The paper addresses an important problem (exploration), suggesting a ""simple"" (compared to density estimation) counting method via hashing.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,It is a nice alternative approach to the one offered by Bellemare et al.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"If discussion among reviewers were possible, I would now try to assemble an argument to accept the paper.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Specifically, I am not as concerned about beating the state of the art in Montezuma's as Reviewer3 as the merit of the current paper is one the simplicity of the hashing and on the wide comparison of domains vs. the baseline TRPO.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,This paper shows that we should not give up on simple hashing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"There still seems to be a bunch of fiddly bits to get this to work, and I am still not confident that these results are easily reproducible.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Nonetheless, it is an interesting new contrasting approach to exploration which deserves attention.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Not important for the decision: The argument in the rebuttal concerning DQN & A3C is a bit of a straw man.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"I did not mention anything at all about A3C, I strictly referred to DQN, which is less sensitive to parameter-tuning than A3C. Also, Bellemare 2016 main result on Montezuma used DQN.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Hence the omission of these techniques applied to DQN still seems a bit strange (for the Atari experiments).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The figure S9 from Mnih et al. points to instances of asynchronous one-step Sarsa with varied thread counts.. of course this will be sensitive to parameters: it is both asynchronous online algorithms *and* the parameter varied is the thread count!,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"This is hardly indicative of DQN's sensitivity to parameters, since DQN is (a) single-threaded (b) uses experience replay, leading to slower policy changes.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Another source of stability, DQN uses a target network that changes infrequently.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Perhaps the authors made a mistake in the reference graph in the figure?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"(I see no Figure 9 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v2.pdf , I assume the authors meant Figure S9)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"This paper proposed to use a simple count-based exploration technique in high-dimensional RL application (e.g., Atari Games).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"The counting is based on state hash, which implicitly groups (quantizes) similar state together.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The hash is computed either via hand-designed features or learned features (unsupervisedly with auto-encoder).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The new state to be explored receives a bonus similar to UCB (to encourage further exploration).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Overall the paper is solid with quite extensive experiments.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,I wonder how it generalizes to more Atari games.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"Montezuma’s Revenge may be particularly suitable for approaches that implicitly/explicitly cluster states together (like the proposed one), as it has multiple distinct scenarios, each with small variations in terms of visual appearance, showing clustering structures.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"On the other hand, such approaches might not work as well if the state space is fully continuous (e.g. in RLLab experiments).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,The authors did not answer my question about why the hash code needs to be updated during training.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,I think it is mainly because the code still needs to be adaptive for a particular game (to achieve lower reconstruction error) in the first few iterations .,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,After that stabilization is the most important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,Sec. 2.3 (Learned embedding) is quite confusing (but very important).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyOvg6jxx,"I hope that the authors could make it more clear (e.g., by writing an algorithm block) in the next version.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,The papers investigates the task of unsupervised learning with deep features via k-means clustering.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,The entire pipeline can be decomposed into two steps: (1) unsupervised feature learning based on GAN framework and (2) k-means clustering using learned deep network features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"Following the GAN framework and its extension InfoGAN, the first step is to train a pair of discriminator network and generator network from scratch using min-max objective.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"Then, it applies k-means clustering on the top layer features from discriminator network.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"For evaluation, the proposed unsupervised feature learning approach is compared against traditional hand-crafted features such as HOG and supervised method on three benchmark datasets.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted RAND Index (ARI) have been used as the evaluation metrics for experimental comparison.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"Although the proposed method may be potentially useful in practice (if refined further), I find the method lacks novelty, and the experimental results are not significant enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,This paper proposed an unsupervised learning method based on running kmeans on the features learned by a discriminator network in a generative adversarial network setup.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,Unsupervised learning methods with GANs is certainly a relevant topic but this paper does not propose anything particularly novel as far as I can tell.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"More importantly, the evaluation methods in this paper are extremely lacking.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,The authors omit classification results on CIFAR and STL-10 and instead the only quantitative evaluation plot the performance of the clustering algorithm on the features.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"Not only are classification results not shown, no comparisons are made to the wealth of related work.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,I list just a few highly related techniques below.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ8BZTjeg,"Finally, it appear the authors have not train their GANs correctly as the samples in Fig.2 appear to be from a model that has collapsed during training.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Sec. 5: ""appears to provide more accurate models"" I don't think you showed this",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,there's no direct comparison to the Sohl-Dickstein paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Fig 4.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,neat!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The paper presents a method for training a generative model via an iterative denoising procedure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The denoising process is initialized with a random sample from a crude approximation to the data distribution and produces a high quality sample via multiple denoising steps.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Training is performed by setting-up a Markov chain that slowly blends propositions from the current denoising model with a real example from the data distribution; using this chain the current denoising model is updated towards reproducing the changed, ""better"", samples from the blending process.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,This is a clearly written paper that considers an interesting approach for training generative models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I was intrigued by the simplicity of the presented approach and really enjoyed reading the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The proposed method is novel although it has clear ties to other recent work aiming to use denoising models for sampling from distributions such as the work by Sohl-Dickstein and the recent work on using DAEs as generative models.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I think this general direction of research is important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"The proposed procedure takes inspiration from the perspective of generating samples by minimizing an energy function via transitions along a Markov chain and, if successful, it can potentially sidestep many problems of current procedures for training directed generative models such as:",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,convergence and mode coverage problems as in generative adversarial networks,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,problems with modeling multi-modal distributions which can arise when a too restrictive approximate inference model is paired with a powerful generative model,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"That being said, another method that seems promising for addressing these issues that also has some superficially similarity to the presented work is the idea of combining Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference with variational inference as in [1].",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,As such I am not entirely convinced that the method presented here will be able to perform better than the mentioned paper; although it might be simpler to train.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Similarly, although I agree that using a MCMC chain to generate samples via a MC-EM like procedure is likely very costly I am not convinced such a procedure won't at least also work reasonably well for the simple MNIST example.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,In general a more direct comparison between different inference methods using an MCMC chain like procedure would be nice to have but I understand that this is perhaps out of the scope of this paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"One thing that I would have expected, however, is a direct comparison to the procedure from Sohl-Dickstein in terms of sampling steps and generation quality as it is so directly related.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Other major points (good and bad):,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Although in general the method is explained well some training details are missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Most importantly it is never mentioned how alpha or omega are set (I am assuming omega is 0.01 as that is the increase mentioned in the experimental setup).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,It is also unclear how alpha affects the capabilities of the generator.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,While it intuitively seems reasonable to use a small alpha over many steps to ensure slow blending of the two distributions it is not clear how necessary this is or at what point the procedure would break (I assume alpha = 1 won't work as the generator then would have to magically denoise a sample from the relatively uninformative draw from p0 ?).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The authors do mention in one of the figure captions that the denoising model does not produce good samples in only 1-2 steps but that might also be an artifact of training the model with small alpha (at least I see no a priori reason for this).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,More experiments should be carried out here.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"No infusion chains or generating chains are shown for any of the more complicated data distributions, this is unfortunate as I feel these would be interesting to look at.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The paper does a good job at evaluating the model with respect to several different metrics.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The bound on the log-likelihood is nice to have as well!,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Unfortunately the current approach does not come with any theoretical guarantees.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,It is unclear for what choices of alpha the procedure will work and whether there is some deeper connection to MCMC sampling or energy based models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,In my eyes this does not subtract from the value of the paper but would perhaps be worth a short sentence in the conclusion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Minor points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The second reference seems broken,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Figure 3 starts at 100 epochs and, as a result, contains little information.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Perhaps it would be more useful to show the complete training procedure and put the x-axis on a log-scale ?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The explanation regarding the convolutional networks you use makes no sense to me.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"You write that you use the same structure as in the ""Improved GANs"" paper which, unlike your model, generates samples from a fixed length random input.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I thus suppose you don't really use a generator with 1 fully connected network followed by up-convolutions but rather have several stages of convolutions followed by a fully connected layer and then up-convolutions ?,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Copied here from my response below:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I believe the response of the authors clarifies all open issues.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"The only remaining issue I have with the paper is that, as the authors acknowledge the architecture of the generator is likely highly sub-optimal and might hamper the performance of the method in the evaluation.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,This however does not at all subtract from any of the main points of the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I am thus keeping my score as a clear accept.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"I want to emphasize that I believe the paper should be published (just in case the review process results in some form of cut-off threshold that is high due to overall ""inflated"" review scores).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"This paper introduces a heuristic approach for training a deep directed generative model, where similar to the transition operator of a Markov chain each layer samples from the same conditional distribution.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Similar to optimizing a variational lower bound, the approach is to approximate the gradient by replacing the posterior over latents with an alternative distribution.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"However, the approximating distribution is not updated to improve the lower bound but heuristically constructed in each step.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,A further difference to variational optimization is that the conditional distributions are optimized greedily rather than following the gradient of the joint log-likelihood.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Review:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,The proposed approach is interesting and to me seems worth exploring more.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Given that there are approaches for training the same class of models which are 1) theoretically more sound, 2) of similar computational complexity, and 3) work well in practice (e.g. Rezende & Mohamed, 2015), I am nevertheless not sure of its potential to generate impact.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"My bigger concern, however, is that the empirical evaluation is still quite limited.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,I appreciate the authors included proper estimates of the log-likelihood.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,This will enable and encourage future comparisons with this method on continuous MNIST.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"However, the authors should point out that the numbers taken from Wu et al. (2016) are not representative of the performance of a VAE.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"(From the paper: “Therefore, the log-likelihood values we report should not be compared directly against networks which have a more flexible observation model.”",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"“Such observation models can easily achieve much higher log-likelihood scores, […].”)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Comparisons with inpainting results using other methods would have been nice.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,How practical is the proposed approach compared to other approaches?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,"Similar to the diffusion approach by Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015), the proposed approach seems to be both efficient and effective for inpainting.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJAFbaolg,Not making this a bigger point and performing the proper evaluations seems like a missed opportunity.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqFGTslg,Therefore I'm inclined to accept it.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJqFGTslg,The only major downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"This paper proposes a nonparametric neural network model, which automatically learns the size of the model during the training process.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The key idea is to randomly add zero units and use sparse regularizer to automatically null out the weights that are irrelevant.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The idea sounds to be a random search approach over discrete space with the help of sparse regularization to eliminate useless units.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,This is an important problem and the paper gives interesting results.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,My main comments are listed below:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,What is the additional computation complexity of the algorithm?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The decomposition of each fan-in weights into a parallel component and an orthogonal component and the transformation into radial-angular coordinates may require a lot of extra computation time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The authors may need to discuss the extra amount of operations relative to the parametric neural network.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"Furthermore, it would be useful to show some running time experiments.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,It is observed that nonparametric networks return small networks on the convex dataset so that it is inferior to parametric networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Any insight on this?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,I agree with reviewer 2 on the interesting part of the paper.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The idea of removing or adding units is definitely an interesting direction, that will make a model grow or shrink along the lines required by the problem and the data, not the user prior knowledge.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The authors offer an interesting theoretical result that proves that under fan out or fan in regularization the optimum of the error function is achieved for finite number of parameters - so the net does not grow indefinitely, until it over-fits perfectly the data.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"That reminds me of more traditional approaches such as Lasso or Elastic Net, in which the regularization produces sparse weights.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,I would  have like more intuition to be given for this theorem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"It is a nice result, somewhat expected (at last for me it is intuitive) and I would have liked such intuition to be given some space in the paper.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"For example, less discussion of prior work (that is nice too, but not as important as discussing and studying the main result of the paper) could make more room for addressing the theoretical results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Please also see below (point 2) for some suggestions.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,I have a few other comments to make:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"1. An interesting experiment would be to show that a model such as yours, where the nodes (neurons) are added or removed automatically can outperform a net with the same number of nodes (at the end, after complete learning), in which the size and number of nodes per layer are fixed from the start. This would prove the efficiency of the idea. This is where your method is interesting: do you save nodes that are not needed and replace them with nodes that are needed? Do you optimize performance vs. memory?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"I understand that experiments along this line are given in Figure 2, with mixed results.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The Figure i must say, is not very clear, but it is possible to interpret under careful inspection.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,In some the non-parametric nets are doing better and others are doing worse than the parametric ones.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Even in such case i could see the usefulness of the method as it helps discovering the structure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"What i don't fully understand is why they can do better sometimes than the end net which could be trained from scratch: why is the nonparametric version of learning better than the parametric version, when the final net is known in advance?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Could you give more insight?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"2. Can you better discuss the meaning and implications of Theorem 1. I feel this theorem is just put there with no proper discussion. Beyond the proofs, from the Appendix, what is the key insight of the Theorem? What does it say, in plain English? To me, the conclusion seems almost natural and obvious. Is there some powerful insight?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"As i have mentioned previously, i feel this theoretical result deserves more space, with even more experiments to back it up.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"For example, can regularizer parameter lambda  be predicted given the data - is there a property in the data that can help guessing the right lambda?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,My feeling is that lambda is the key factor for determining the final net structure.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Is this true?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,How much does the structure of the final net depend on the initialization?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Do you get different nets if you start from different random weights?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,How different are they?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,What happens when fan in and fan out regularizers are combined?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Do you still have the same theoretical result?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,I have a few additional questions:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"1. Why do you say that adding zero units changes the regularizer value? For example, does L2 norm change if you add zero values?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"2. Zero units are defined as having either the fan in or the fan out weights being zero. I think that what you meant is that both fan in and fan out weights are zero, otherwise you cannot remove the unit and keep the same output f. This should be clarified better I think.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"I changed my rating to 7, while hoping that the authors will address my comments above.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,This paper addresses the problem of allowing networks to change the number of units that are used during training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,This is done in a simple but elegant and well-motivated way.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"Units with zero input or output weights are added or removed during training, while a group sparsity norm for regularization is used to encourage unit weights to go to zero.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The main theoretical contribution is to show that with proper regularization, the loss is minimized by a network with a finite number of units.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"In practice, this result does not guarantee that the resulting network will not over- or under-fit the training data, but some initial experiments show that this does not seem to be the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,One potential advantage of approaches that learn the number of units to use in a network is to ease the burden of tuning hyperparameters.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,One disadvantage of this approach (and maybe any such approach) is that it does not really solve this problem.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The network still has several hyperparameters that implicitly control the number of units that will emerge, including parameters that control how often new units are added and how rapidly weights may decay to zero.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,It is not clear whether these hyperparameters will be easier or harder to tune than the ones in standard approaches.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"In fairness, the authors do not claim that they have made training easier, but it is a little disappointing that this does not seem to be the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The authors do emphasize that they are able to train networks that use fewer units to achieve comparable performance to networks trained parametrically.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"This is potentially important, because smaller networks can reduce run-time at testing, and power consumption and memory footprint, which is important on mobile devices in particular.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"However, the authors do not compare experimentally to existing approaches that attempt to reduce the size of parametrically trained networks (eg., by pruning trained networks)",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,so it is not clear whether this approach is really competitive with the best current approaches to reducing the size of trained networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,Another potential disadvantage of the proposed approach is that the same hyperparameters control both the number of units that will appear in the network and the training time.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"Therefore, training might potentially be much slower for this approach than for a parametric approach with fixed hyperparameters.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"In practice, many parametric approaches require methods like grid search to choose hyperparameters, which can be very slow, but in many other cases experience with similar problems can make the choice of hyperparameters relatively easy.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"This means that the cost of grid search is not always paid, but the slowness of the authors’ approach may be endemic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,The authors do not discuss how this issue will scale as much larger networks are trained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"It is a concern that this approach may not be practical for large-scale networks, because training will be very slow.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"In general, the experiments are helpful and encouraging, but not comprehensive or totally convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,I would want to see experiments on much larger problems before I was convinced that this approach can really be practical or widely useful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"Overall, I found this to be an interesting and clearly written paper that makes a potentially useful point.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,"The overall vision of building networks that can grow and adapt through life-long learning is inspiring, and this type of work might be needed to realize such a vision.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJK3Xasel,But the current results remain pretty speculative.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"First of all, I would like to thank the authors for putting this much work into a necessary but somewhat tedious topic.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"While I think the paper is somewhat below the standard of a conference paper (see detailed comments below), I would definitely love to see a version of this paper published with some of the issues ironed out.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,I also agree with many of the points raised by other reviewers and will not repeat them here.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Major points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"""As we saw in the previous section, the minima of deep network loss functions are for the most part decent.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"All you said in the previous section was that theory shows that there are no bad minima under ""strong assumptions"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,There is no practical proof that minima do not vary in quality.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"""This implies that we probably do not need to take many precautions to avoid bad minima in practice.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"If all minima are decent, then the task of finding a ""decent minima quickly"" is reduced to the task of finding any minima quickly.""",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"First of all, as one of the reviewers pointed out, we are never guaranteed in practice to actually reach a local minimum.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,We could always hit a region of the objective function where the algorithm makes essentially no further progress.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"The final error level, in practice, actually does depend significantly on many factors such as (i) optimization algorithm (ii) learning rate schedule (iii) initialization of weights (iv) presence of unsupervised pretraining (v) whether neurons are added or eliminated during training etc. etc.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"Therefore, the task of optimizing neural networks is far from being ""reduced to finding any minima quickly"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Figure 1,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"I don't like Figure 1, because it suggests to me that you diagnosed exactly where the transition between the two phases happened, which I don't think you did.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"Also, the concept of having a fast-decaying error followed by a slow-decaying error is simple enough for readers to understand without a dedicated graph.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Minor point on presentation: The red brace is positioned lower in the figure than the blue brace and the braces don't join up horizontally.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Please be more careful.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Misuse of the transient phase / minimization phase concept,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"In section 4.3, you talk about the transient and minimization phase of optimization.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"However, you have no way of diagnosing when or if your algorithm reaches the minimization phase.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,You seem to think that the minimization phase is simply the part of the optimization process where the error decreases slowly.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"AFAIK, this is not the case.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,The minimization phase is where the optimization algorithm enters the vicinity of the local minimum that can be approximated by the second-order Taylor expansion.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"For this to even occur, one would have to verify, for example, that the learning rate is small enough.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"You change the algorithm after 25%, 50% and 75% of training, but these points seem arbitrary.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"What is the minimization phase was reached at 99%, or 10 epochs after you decided to stop training?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Only 1 dataset,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,You run most experiments on only 1 dataset (CIFAR).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Please replicate with at least one more dataset.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Many figures are unclear,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"For each figure, the following information are relevant: network used; dataset used; learning rate used; batch norm yes / no; whether figure shows train, test, or validation error.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"It should be easy for the reader to ascertain this information for all figures, not just for some.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,You say at the beginning of section 4.1 that each algorithm finds a different minimum as if this is a significant finding.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"However, this is obvious because the updates taken by these algorithms vary wildly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Keep in mind that there is an exponentially large number of minima.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,The probability of different algorithms choosing the same minimum is essentially zero because of their sheer number.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,The same would be true if you even shift the learning rate slightly or use a different random seed for minibatch generation etc. etc.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Lack of confidence intervals,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"The value of Figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 is limited is because it is unclear how these plots would change if the random seed were changed.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,We only get information for a single weight initialization and a single minibatch sequence.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"While figures 5 and 7 can be used to try and infer what confidence intervals around plots in figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 might look like, I think those confidence intervals should still be shown for at least a subset of the configurations presented.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Lack of information regarding learning rate,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,There is big question mark left open regarding how all your results would change if different learning rates were used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,You don't even tell us how you chose the learning rates from the intervals you gave in section 3.4.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Lack of information regarding the absolute distance of interpolated points,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"In most figures, you interpolate between two or three trained weight configuration.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"However, you do not say how far the interpolated points are apart.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"This is highly significant, because if points are close together and there is a big ""hump"" between them, it means that those points are more ""brittle"" than if they are far apart and there is a big ""hump"" between them.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,Minor points:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"LSTM is not a fixed network architecture like NiN or VGG, but a layer type.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,LSTM would be equivalent to CNN.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"Also, the VGG paper has multiple versions of VGG.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,You should specify which one you used.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,The font size for the legends in the upper triangle of Table 1 is too small.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"You can't just write ""best viewed in zoom"" in the table caption and pretend that somehow fixes the problem.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"Personally, I prefer no legend over an unreadable legend.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"The paper is dedicated to better understanding the optimization landscape in deep learning, in particular when explored with different optimization algorithms, and thus it also characterizes the behavior of these algorithms.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,It heavily re-uses the approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"I find it hard to understand the contributions of the paper, for example: is it surprising that different algorithms reach different solutions when starting from the same initialization?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,It would be useful if the authors build such basic intuition in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,I also did not receive a clear answer to the question I posed to reviewers regarding clarifying how does the findings of the paper can contribute to future works on optimization in deep learning.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,And this is what I find fundamentally missing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkuDV6iex,"So for example, there are probably plenty of ways to modify approach of Goodfellow et al.

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,This paper argues that being able to handle recursion is very important for neural programming architectures — that handling recursion allows for strong generalization to out of domain test cases and learning from smaller amounts of training data.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,Most of the paper is a riff on the Reed & de Freitas paper on Neural Programmer Interpreters from ICLR 2016 which learns from program traces — this paper trains NPI models on traces that have recursive calls.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,"For example, a larger input domain (as one of the reviewers also mentions) is MNIST digits and we can imagine a problem where the NPI must infer how to sort MNIST digits from highest to lowest.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,"In this setting, having execution traces would effectively decouple the problem of recognizing the digits from that of inferring the program logic — and so the problem would be no harder than learning to recognize MNIST digits and learning to bubble sort from symbols.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,"As a non-expert on this topic, it was easy to read the original paper in tandem.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkbY4psgg,My one point of critique is that the generalization proves are a bit vague.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,It reported a series of experiments on various small tasks and feed-forward DNNs.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,Although the goal is interesting I found their conclusion is neither convincing nor useful in practice for several reasons:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"1. They only explored really simple networks (feed-forward DNNs). While this significantly limited the search space, it also limited the value of the experiments. In fact, the best model architecture is highly task (domain) dependent and the type of model (DNN vs CNN vs LSTM) is often much more important than size of the network itself.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"2. Their experiments were conduced with some important hyper parameters (e.g., learning rate schedule) fixed. However, it is well known  that learning rate often is the most important hyper parameter during training. Without adjusting these important hyper parameters the conclusion on the best model architecture is not convincing.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"3. Their experiments seem to indicate that the training data difference is not important. However, this is unlikely to be true as you would definitely want to use larger models (total number of parameters) when your training set is magnitude larger (i.e., log(datasize) can be an important feature). This is likely because they did not run experiments on large datasets.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"In addition, I think the title of the paper does not accurately reflect what the paper is about and should be modified.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,Although it's interesting it's not ready for publishing.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,This paper presents an intriguing study of how one can pose architecture search as a meta learning problem.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,By collecting features from networks trained on various datasets and training a “ranking classifier” (the actual details of the classifier do not seem to be described in detail) one can potentially infer what a good architecture for a new problem could be by simply running the ranker on the extracted features for a new problem setup.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,One notable comment from the paper is that the authors fix some important hyper-parameters for all the networks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I am of the opinion that optimizing the learning rate (and its decay schedule) is actually quite important.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I hypothesize that a lot of the conclusions of this paper may change quite a bit if the authors did an actual search over the rates instead.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"I suspect that instead of training 11k nets, one can train 2k nets with 5 learning rates each and get a much better result that is actually compelling.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I am not convinced that the protocol for generating the various architectures is doing a good job at creating a diversity of architecture (simply because of the max depth of 8 layers and 14 components overall).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I suspect that most of these generated architectures are actually almost identical performance-wise and that it’s a waste to train so many of them on so many tasks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"Unless the authors are already doing this, they should define a pruning mechanism that filters out nets that are too similar to already existing ones.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,The batch normalization experiments in Table 2 seem odd and under-explained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"It is also well-known that the optimal learning rates when using batch norm vs. not using batch norm can differ by an order of magnitude so given the fixed learning rate throughout all experiments, I take these results with some grain of salt.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I am not sure we got many insights into the kinds of architectures that ended up being at the top.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"Either visualizations, or trends (or both), would be great.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"This work seems to conflate the study of parallel vs. serial architectures with the study of meta learning, which are somewhat distinct issues.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,I take issue with the table that compares parallel vs. serial performance (table 2) simply because the right way would be to filter the architectures by the same number of parameters / capacity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"Ultimately the conclusion seems to be that when applying deep nets in a new domain, it is difficult to come up with a good architecture in advance.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,"In that sense, it is hard to see the paper as a constructive result, because it’s conclusions are that while the ranker may do a good job often-times, it’s not that reliable.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx5BTilg,Thus I am not convinced that this particular result will be of practical use to folks who are intending to use deep nets for a new domain.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,Showing results on several more games and/or other domains would significantly improve the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,Showing error bars from multiple random seeds would also improve the paper.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,"As in other recent work on deep RL, the forward view of Sutton and Barto is used to make eligibility traces practical to use with neural networks.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,Experiments on the Atari games Pong and Tennis show that traces work better than standard Q-learning.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,"The paper is well written and the use of traces in deep RL is indeed underexplored, but the experiments in the paper are too limited and do not answer the most interesting questions.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,"As pointed out in the questions, n-step returns have been shown to work better than 1-step returns both in the classical RL literature and more recently with deep networks.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,[1] shows that using n-step returns in the forward view with neural networks leads to big improvements on both Atari and TORCS.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,"Their n-step Q-learning method also combines returns of different length in expectation, while traces do this explicitly.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,This paper does not compare traces with n-step returns and simply shows that traces used in the forward view help on two Atari games.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,This is not a very significant result.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,It would be much more interesting to see whether traces improve on what is already known to work well with neural networks.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,The other claimed contribution of the paper is showing the strong effect of optimization.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,"As with traces, I find it hard to make any conclusions from experiments on two games with fixed hyperparameter settings.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,This has already been demonstrated with much more thorough experiments in other papers.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,One could argue that these experiments show that importance of hyperparameter values and not of the optimization algorithm itself.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJrDIpiee,Without tuning the optimization hyperparameters it's hard to claim anything about the relative merits of the methods.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,This paper addresses the issue of how to evaluate automatic dialogue responses.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"This is an important issue because current practice to automatically evaluate (e.g. BLEU, based on N-gram overlap, etc.) is NOT correlated well with the desired quality (i.e. human annotation).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"The proposed approach is based on the use of an LSTM encoding of dialogue context, reference response and model response with appropriate scoring, with the essence of training one dialogue model to evaluate another model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"However, the proposed solution depends on a reasonably good dialogue model to begin with, which is not guaranteed, rendering the new metric possibly meaningless.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"This paper propose a new evaluation metric for dialogue systems, and show it has a higher correlation with human annotation.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"I agree the MT based metrics like BLEU are too simple to capture enough semantic information, but the metric proposed in this paper seems to be too compliciated to explain.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"On the other hand, we could also use equation 1 as a retrieval based dialogue system.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,So what is suggested in this paper is basically to train one dialogue model to evaluate another model.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"Then, the high-level question is why we should trust this model?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,This question is also relevant to the last item of my detail comments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,Detail comments:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,How to justify what is captured/evaluated by this metric?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"In terms of BLEU, we know it actually capture n-gram overlap.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"But for this model, I guess it is hard to say what is captured.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"If this is true, then it is also difficult to answer the question like: will the data dependence be a problem?",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,why not build model incrementally?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"As shown in equation (1), this metric uses both context and reference to compute a score.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,Is it possible to show the score function using only reference?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,It will guarantee this metric use the same information source as BLEU or ROUGE.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"Another question about equation (1), is it possible to design the metric to be a nonlinear function.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"Since from what I can tell, the comparison between BLEU (or ROUGE) and the new metric in Figure 3 is much like a comparison between the exponential scale and the linear scale.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,I found the two reasons in section 5.2 are not convincing if we put them together.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"Based on these two reasons, I would like to see the correlation with average score.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,A more reasonable way is to show the results both with and without averaging.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"In table 6, it looks like the metric favors the short responses.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"If that is true, this metric basically does the opposite of BLEU, since BLEU will panelize short sentences.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"On the other hand, human annotators also tends to give short respones high scores, since long sentences will have a higher chance to contain some irrelevant words.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,Can we eliminate the length factor during the annotation?,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,"Otherwise, it is not surprise that the correlation.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,While the overall approach is simple it is also quite intuitiv and allows end-to-end training.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,As the authors rightly argue simplicity is a feature both for interpretation as well as for speed.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,The experimental section reports on quite a range of experiments that seem fine to me and aim to convince the reader about the applicability of the approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,As mentioned also by others more insights from the experiments would have been great.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,I mentioned an in-depth failure case analysis and I would also suggest to go beyond the current dataset to really show generalizability of the proposed approach.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJ5PIaseg,In my opinion the paper is somewhat weaker on that front that it should have been.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1oK8aoxe,"Thus it is interesting to see it apply on harder, non-locomotion domains, where ideal sub-policies are not that similar, e.g. for manipulation, solving some task from one state can be very different from solving it from another state.",1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_4vpixl,My own issues with this way of thinking is: a) what about representational power; restricting to orthogonal matrices it means we can not represent the same family of functions as before (e.g. we can't have complex attractors and so forth if we run the model forward without any inputs).,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_4vpixl,You can only get those if you have eigenvalues larger than 1.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_4vpixl,"It also becomes really hard to deal with noise (since you attempt to preserve every detail of the input, or rather every part of the input affects the output).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_4vpixl,Ideally you would want to preserve only what you need for the task given limited capacity.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_4vpixl,But you can't learn to do that.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,Summary: This paper presents a differentiable histogram filter for state estimation/tracking. The proposed histogram filter is a particular Bayesian filter that represents the discretized states using beliefs. The prediction step is parameterized by a locally linear and translation-invariant motion model while the measurement model is represented by a multi-layered neural network. The whole system is learned with both supervised and unsupervised objectives and experiments are carried out on two synthetic robot localization tasks (1D and 2D). The major claim of this paper is that the problem-specific model structure (Bayesian filter for state estimation) should improve pure deep learning approach in data-efficiency and generalization ability.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,+This paper has nice arguments about the importance of prior knowledge to deep learning approach for specific tasks.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,+An end-to-end histogram filter is derived for state estimation and unsupervised learning is possible in this model.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,This paper seems to have a hidden assumption that deep learning (RNN) is a natural choice for recursive state estimation and the rest of paper is built upon this assumption including LSTM baselines.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"However, this assumption itself may not be true, because Bayesian filter is a first-established approach for this classic problem, so it it more important to justify if deep learning is even necessary for solving the tasks presented.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,This requests pure Bayesian filter baselines in the experiments.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,The derived histogram filter seems to be particularly designed for discretized state space.,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"It is not clear how well it can be generalized to continuous state space using the notation ""x"".",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"More interestingly, the observation is discrete (binary) as well, which eventually makes it possible to derive a closed-form measurement update model.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,This setup might be too constrained.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"Generalizing to continuous observations is not a trivial task, not even to mention using images as observations like Haarnoja et al 2016.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,These design choices overall narrow down the scope of applicability.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,Summary:,1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,The authors propose a histogram based state representation with differentiable motion models and observation updates for state tracking from observations.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,Negatives:,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"1. The motion model is too simplistic. The authors in their response to earlier questions say that a generic feed-forward neural network could be used to model more complicated motions. However, then the novelty of their framework is not clear",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,as then the proposed model would just be a couple of neural networks to learn the motion and observation models.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"2. The observation model again is too simplistic (e.g., one dimensional observations), and is proposed to be a generic feed-forward network. Here again, the technical novelty is not clear.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"4. In Figure 5(a,b), where they compare the state-estimation accuracy with other baselines (i.e., LSTMs), it is clear that the accuracy of the LSTM has not saturated, while that of their model has. They should do larger scale experiments with more training data (e.g., 10k,100k,500k samples).",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"Note that while sample efficiency is a desirable property (also discussed in Section 6.2), we do expect models with prior knowledge to work better for small number of samples than models which do not assume any structure.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,Experiments with larger number of samples would be insightful.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,"I think the proposed method is too simplistic to be useful in the presented form, eg. 1) the state space (dimensionality & topology) is exactly matched to the experiments 2) displacements in the transition model are linear in the actions 3) observations are one-dimensional.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByvJuTigl,Furthermore the authors do not compare to any other method except for an out-of-the-box LSTM model.,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,"This thus borrows from both denoising (DAE) for the stochasticity and from the contractive (CAE) auto-encoders objectives (which the paper doesn’t compare to) for the representational closeness, and as such appears rather incremental.",0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,"In common with the CAE, a collapse of the representation can only be avoided by additional external constraints, such as tied weights, batch normalization or other normalization heuristics.",0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,Note that such external constraints do not seem to arise from the information-theoretic formalism as articulated by the authors.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,This casts doubt regarding the validity or completeness of the proposed formal motivation as currently exposed.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,What the extra regularization does from an information-theoretic perspective remains unclearly articulated (e.g. interpretation of lambda strength?).,0

https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,"The new term is well motivated, it introduces an asymmetry between the encoder and decoder, forcing the encoder to represent a compressed, denoised version of the input.",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,"The authors propose to avoid the trivial solution introduced by the new term by using tied weights or normalized Euclidean distance error (the trivial solution occurs by scaling the magnitude of the code down in the encoder, and back up in the decoder).",1
https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1ZXuTolx,The proposed auto-encoder scheme is very similar to a host of other auto-encoders that have been out in the literature for some time.,1

https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sks9_ajex,The attention terminology is misleading in the paper.,0
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sks9_ajex,The proposed method really just try to distill the summed squared(or other statistics e.g. summed lp norm) of  activations in a hidden feature map.,0
